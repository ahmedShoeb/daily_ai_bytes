## Overview

The article addresses the inefficiencies of current AI coding agents, which are wasteful with tokens, lack codebase context, possess only surface-level understanding, and suffer from context rot. The author proposes solutions using vector embeddings for semantic search of functions and graph databases for generating accurate dependency graphs, demonstrating significant reductions in token usage and improved efficiency in AI-assisted code analysis and development.

## Key Points

- Current AI coding agents are inefficient, wasting tokens, lacking codebase context, and suffering from context rot.
- Text-based searching by agents leads to irrelevant information in the context window and degraded LLM performance with increased input length.
- Semantic understanding of functions is achieved through generating summaries using LLMs and storing them as vector embeddings in a PostgreSQL database for similarity search.
- Dependency graphs for functions are accurately and efficiently generated using graph databases like Neo4j, avoiding exhaustive token usage by LLMs.
- Benchmarks show significant reductions in token usage (30-54%) and improved efficiency compared to raw LLM approaches for tasks like finding functions and generating call graphs.
- The author emphasizes using computer science know-how to solve problems trivially, rather than relying solely on general-purpose LLMs, to achieve greater efficiency in AI coding.

## Key Topics Discussed

The article "I Made AI Coding Agents More Efficient" critically examines the shortcomings of contemporary AI coding agents, particularly their tendency towards token wastage, insufficient codebase context retention, superficial code understanding, and susceptibility to "context rot." The author illustrates these issues with examples where agents expend vast amounts of tokens on basic tasks without achieving complete or accurate results, largely due to their reliance on rudimentary text-based searches and the degradation of LLM performance with longer context windows.

To address these problems, the author introduces two primary solutions. First, to improve semantic understanding, the author proposes using an LLM to summarize functions, then generating vector embeddings from these summaries, and storing them in a PostgreSQL database. This enables semantic similarity searches, allowing agents to identify relevant functions even if exact keywords are not present, significantly outperforming traditional keyword searches. Benchmarks demonstrate substantial reductions in token usage for such tasks.

Second, for understanding function dependencies and call graphs, the author advocates for the use of graph databases like Neo4j. By parsing code into a tree representation and building call graphs, the agent can quickly and accurately retrieve all call paths leading to a specific function, a task that LLMs struggle with and consume many tokens on without exhaustive results. This method dramatically improves efficiency and accuracy in analyzing code structure.

The article concludes by emphasizing that while AI coding agents are powerful, integrating classic computer science principles—like semantic search with vector embeddings and dependency analysis with graph databases—can make them far more efficient and effective, moving beyond the "swiss army knife" approach of raw LLMs to solve problems more trivially and with less resource consumption.
