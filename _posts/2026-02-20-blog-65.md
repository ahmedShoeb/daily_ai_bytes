## Key Points

Welo Data helps enterprise AI teams operationalize human judgment as infrastructure with built-in calibration, auditability, and control
Enterprise AI programs often fail not due to model performance issues, but because human decisions can't be explained, repeated, or defended at scale
AI quality breaks at scale due to inconsistent human evaluations across teams, lack of shared calibration standards, and unreviewable automation outputs
Quality drift in AI systems is a systems problem, not a people problem - unstructured human judgment operating without operational guardrails
Welo Data provides infrastructure to standardize evaluator decision-making, continuously calibrate judgment, and surface quality drift before production impact
LLM-based automated judges inherit unexamined assumptions and biases without human oversight, making errors harder to detect and correct
Execution-only labeling approaches generate volume without shared decision frameworks, producing outputs that can't be audited or defended
The solution requires clear human decision frameworks, consistent evaluator interpretation, and oversight mechanisms for ambiguity
Welo Data's systems are designed for heads of AI/ML platforms, quality leaders, GenAI program owners, and risk/compliance stakeholders
Quality must be designed before execution, with decision frameworks, boundary conditions, and ambiguity handling defined upfront
