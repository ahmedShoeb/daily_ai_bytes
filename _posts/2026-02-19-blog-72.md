## Key Points

Flapping Airplanes is a new research-focused AI lab with $180 million in seed funding
The lab is focused on solving AI's 'data efficiency problem' - making AI learn with far less data than current models
Co-founded by brothers Ben and Asher Spector, and Aidan Smith (ex-Neuralink)
They aim to find fundamentally different AI architectures inspired by but not limited to how the human brain works
Unlike current models that need 'rivers and rivers of data,' they want systems that can learn new skills quickly with minimal examples
The name 'Flapping Airplanes' represents creating something new - not trying to build birds (brains) or Boeing 787s (current AI), but something in between
They're hiring very young, creative researchers who can think outside established paradigms, often still in college or high school
Potential applications include robotics, scientific discovery, and enterprise AI where models need to adapt quickly with limited data
They believe this approach could enable AI to do things humans fundamentally can't do, not just automate existing jobs
The founders have set up specific email addresses for engagement: Hi@ and Disagree@flappingairplanes.com
