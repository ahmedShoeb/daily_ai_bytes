## Key Points

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is proposing an "Apps Extension" (SEP-1865) to standardize interactive user interfaces for MCP servers.
This extension aims to address the limitations of current MCP servers, which are restricted to text and structured data, making visual information and complex user input difficult.
The proposal builds upon the successful work of the MCP-UI project and OpenAI Apps SDK, which demonstrated the demand for agentic apps with rich UI experiences.
Key design principles include pre-declared UI templates, using MCP's existing JSON-RPC for communication, and initially supporting `text/html` rendered in sandboxed iframes.
Security is a top priority, with measures like iframe sandboxing, predeclared templates, auditable messages, and user consent for UI-initiated tool calls.
The MCP Apps Extension is optional and backward compatible, allowing for gradual adoption and requiring servers to provide text-only fallbacks.
This initiative is a collaborative effort involving MCP Core Maintainers from OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as the MCP-UI creators and community.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! Today, we've got some exciting news from the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, community. They're introducing a new proposal called the 'MCP Apps Extension,' also known as SEP-1865. This is a pretty big deal because it aims to standardize support for interactive user interfaces directly within the Model Context Protocol. Now, why is this important? Well, right now, MCP servers are mostly limited to just exchanging text and structured data with hosts. While that works for a lot of things, it creates some friction when tools need to show you visual information or get more complex input from users. Think about it: if a data visualization server returns chart data as JSON, the host application has to do all the heavy lifting to interpret and render that data. As more UI needs pop up, this gets really complicated for developers. The MCP community has been finding workarounds, but without a standard, it could lead to fragmentation in the ecosystem, which they're actively trying to prevent. This new extension builds on some fantastic work already done by the MCP-UI project, created by Ido Salomon and Liad Yosef, and the OpenAI Apps SDK. Both of these have really proven the demand for agentic apps with interactive interfaces. They've shown that delivering rich user interfaces as first-class MCP resources fits naturally within the MCP architecture. To ensure everything plays nicely together, Anthropic, OpenAI, and MCP-UI are all collaborating on this official MCP extension. Let's talk about some of the key design decisions for the MCP Apps Extension. First, they're looking at 'pre-declared resources,' meaning UI templates will have a specific URI scheme, like 'ui://', and be referenced in tool metadata. This allows hosts to prefetch and review templates before a tool even runs, boosting both performance and security. Second, instead of inventing a whole new messaging system, UI components will communicate with hosts using the existing MCP JSON-RPC base protocol over postMessage. This keeps things consistent, auditable, and ensures future MCP features will work seamlessly. Initially, the specification will support only `text/html` content, rendered in sandboxed iframes. This offers universal browser support, a well-understood security model, and a clear starting point for future extensions. And speaking of security, it's a huge focus here. Hosting interactive content from MCP servers requires careful consideration, and the proposal tackles this with multiple layers of defense. This includes iframe sandboxing, allowing hosts to review HTML content before rendering, making all UI-to-host communication auditable via JSON-RPC, and giving hosts the option to require explicit user approval for UI-initiated tool calls. These measures are designed to create defense in depth against malicious servers while still giving developers the flexibility they need. Finally, it's an optional extension, so existing MCP implementations will continue to work without any changes. Hosts can gradually adopt UI support, and servers are encouraged to provide text-only fallbacks for all UI-enabled tools. A huge shoutout goes to the UI Community Working Group, along with the maintainers at MCP-UI, OpenAI, and Anthropic, for their instrumental work in shaping this proposal. They've truly championed the idea of UI resources as a natural part of MCP, and their collaboration has been key to getting this initiative off the ground.
