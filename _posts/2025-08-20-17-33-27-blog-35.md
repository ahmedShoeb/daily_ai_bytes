## Overview

OpenAI has rolled out significant updates to ChatGPT, including new GPT-5 modes (Auto, Fast, Thinking) with varying rate limits and context windows, and made GPT-5 available across all tiers, including free. They are also working on refining GPT-5's personality to be warmer and re-enabled GPT-4o by default for paid users, alongside other model options. These updates emphasize GPT-5's enhanced intelligence, reliability, and capability for complex tasks, aiming for broad accessibility.

## Key Points

**GPT-5 Modes:** Users can now choose between "Auto," "Fast," and "Thinking" modes for GPT-5.
**Rate Limits:** GPT-5 Thinking has a rate limit of 3,000 messages/week, with extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking mini.
**Context Window:** GPT-5 Thinking has a context limit of 196k tokens.
**Availability:** GPT-5 is now available to all users (Free, Plus, Pro, Team), with Enterprise and Edu users gaining access next week.
**GPT-4o:** GPT-4o is back as the default model for all paid users.
**Model Options:** Paid users can access additional models like o3, 4.1, and GPT-5 Thinking mini via settings.
**Personality Refinement:** OpenAI is working to make GPT-5's personality warmer and aims for more per-user customization.
**Core Strengths:** GPT-5 is highlighted for its superior intelligence, intuition, speed, reliability, and factuality, performing well on evaluations like SWE-bench.
**Capabilities:** It can perform complex research, reason, and handle tasks that previously took hours/days and significant cost.
**O1 Series:** New "o1" series models (o1-preview, o1-mini) are introduced for general-purpose complex reasoning, available for Plus/Team users and Tier 5 API users.

## Key Topics Discussed

OpenAI has announced a series of significant updates to its ChatGPT platform, introducing new functionalities and model availabilities. A major highlight is the introduction of new modes for GPT-5: "Auto," "Fast," and "Thinking." While "Auto" is recommended for most users, these modes offer additional control for specific use cases. The "Thinking" mode for GPT-5 comes with a rate limit of 3,000 messages per week and boasts a substantial context limit of 196,000 tokens, with extra capacity available on GPT-5 Thinking mini once the limit is reached. OpenAI notes that rate limits may be adjusted in the future based on usage patterns. A significant development is the expanded availability of GPT-5. The model is now rolling out to all users, including those on the free tier, as well as Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers, with Enterprise and Edu users gaining access in the coming week. This broad accessibility reflects OpenAI's commitment to providing "PhD-level intelligence for everyone." For paid users, GPT-4o has been re-instated as the default model in the picker. Additionally, a "Show additional models" toggle has been added to ChatGPT web settings for paid users, allowing access to other models such as o3, 4.1, and GPT-5 Thinking mini. It's mentioned that GPT-4.5, a highly compute-intensive model, remains exclusively for Pro users. OpenAI is also focusing on refining GPT-5's personality. They are working on an update that aims to make GPT-5 feel warmer than its current iteration, while avoiding the "annoying" characteristics that some users attributed to GPT-4o. A key learning from recent feedback is the strong need for greater per-user customization of model personality in the future. The updates emphasize GPT-5's core strengths, describing it as very smart, intuitive, and fast. It is highlighted for its excellent performance on evaluations, including a new high on SWE-bench and other metrics, making it their most reliable and factual model to date. GPT-5 is capable of complex tasks, such as internet research and reasoning, generating detailed reports, and solving problems that previously required hours or days of human effort and significant cost. An example provided showcases its ability to find a specific car through deep research. Furthermore, OpenAI has introduced a new series of models called "o1," which are described as their most capable and aligned models yet, marking the beginning of a new paradigm for AI in general-purpose complex reasoning. "o1-preview" and "o1-mini" are available immediately for ChatGPT Plus and Team users, and Tier 5 API users. While acknowledging that o1 models are still flawed and limited, they represent a significant step forward. The update also briefly mentions the preview of visual input for GPT-4, with a note that safety challenges will require time to mitigate. Overall, these updates underscore OpenAI's continuous efforts to enhance model capabilities, improve user experience, and expand accessibility across various user segments, while also addressing areas like model personality and safety.
