## Key Topics Discussed

Walmart has announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate shopping capabilities directly into the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot, allowing consumers to make purchases more quickly. This strategic move by the retail giant, the largest U.S. grocer, addresses the shift in consumer behavior where shoppers are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for product discovery, gift ideas, and identifying the best deals. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon emphasized that the new AI feature will offer a “multi-media, personalized and contextual” shopping experience, moving beyond traditional search bar methods. While the exact launch date for Walmart purchases on ChatGPT was not disclosed, shares of Walmart saw a nearly 5% increase following the announcement. OpenAI had previously introduced its Instant Checkout feature, which will facilitate these transactions, initially supporting single-item purchases from Etsy sellers and later expanding to include over one million Shopify merchants. This Instant Checkout feature represents a new revenue stream for OpenAI, which plans to charge companies a fee for transactions completed through ChatGPT. Walmart also maintains its proprietary AI-powered shopping assistant, named Sparky, within its own app.
