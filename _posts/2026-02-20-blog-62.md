## Key Points

- The author responds to economist David Oks' argument that AI job displacement panic is overblown, arguing comparative advantage doesn't guarantee good worker outcomes
- Comparative advantage theory shows some human labor will remain valuable, but says nothing about wages, job numbers, or distribution of gains - workers could still face massive displacement and wage collapse
- The author highlights empirical evidence of early-career worker displacement, with young software developers seeing 20% employment decline while senior workers remain unaffected
- Organizational bottlenecks that slow AI adoption are temporary and AI itself may accelerate their erosion over time
- Displacement is already hitting mid-career professionals in creative fields like illustration, translation, copywriting, and graphic design
- Elastic demand (Jevon's paradox) may increase total output but doesn't protect specific workers or labor markets from catastrophic distributional effects
- Historical patterns of job creation involved moving up cognitive ladders, but this time the cognitive domain itself is being automated
- The critical question isn't just whether jobs exist, but who captures the surplus from AI productivity gains - ownership structures determine whether gains flow broadly or concentrate narrowly
- Benign outcomes from technological transitions require deliberate institutional design, not optimism about natural market processes
- The author argues against telling people not to worry, instead urging focus on political economy and ownership structures to ensure broad sharing of AI benefits
