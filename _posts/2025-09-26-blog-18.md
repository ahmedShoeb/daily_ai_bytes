At the same time, a majority is open to letting AI assist them with day-to-day tasks and activities.

Americans feel strongly that it’s important to be able to tell if pictures, videos or text were made by AI or by humans. Yet many don’t trust their own ability to spot AI-generated content.

## Key Topics Discussed

A Pew Research Center survey reveals that Americans are more concerned than excited about the increasing use of artificial intelligence in daily life, with a significant majority desiring more control over its application. The survey, conducted among 5,023 U.S. adults from June 9 to 15, 2025, highlights a general pessimism regarding AI's impact on human creativity and the ability to form meaningful relationships. Specifically, 53% believe AI will worsen creative thinking, and 50% think it will erode meaningful relationships, while only smaller percentages foresee improvements in these areas. Despite these concerns, a majority of Americans are open to AI assisting them with day-to-day tasks. However, they strongly oppose AI involvement in personal matters like religion or matchmaking, preferring its use for data-intensive tasks such as weather forecasting, financial crime detection, and medical development. Most Americans emphasize the importance of distinguishing between AI-generated and human-created content, yet over half express low confidence in their own ability to do so. The study also notes that awareness of AI is widespread, with 95% of U.S. adults having heard about it. Fifty percent are more concerned than excited about AI's increased use, a rise from 37% in 2021. The societal risks of AI are rated as high by 57% of Americans, with the weakening of human skills and connections being a primary concern. Young adults (under 30) are more aware of and interact more frequently with AI compared to older adults, and they are also more likely to believe AI will negatively impact creativity and relationships.
