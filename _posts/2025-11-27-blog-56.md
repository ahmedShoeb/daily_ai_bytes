## Key Points

Anthropic has released three new advanced tool-use features for its Claude AI models: the Tool Search Tool, Programmatic Tool Calling, and Tool Use Examples.
These features aim to address limitations in traditional AI tool use, such as context window bloat, inference overhead, and imprecise parameter usage.
The Tool Search Tool enables Claude to dynamically discover and load tools on-demand, significantly reducing token consumption (up to 85% reduction) and improving accuracy with large tool libraries.
Programmatic Tool Calling allows Claude to orchestrate tools through Python code in a sandboxed environment, keeping intermediate results out of its context, reducing token usage (37% reduction), decreasing latency, and improving accuracy in complex workflows.
Tool Use Examples provide concrete usage patterns directly in tool definitions, resolving ambiguities in JSON schemas and improving parameter accuracy (from 72% to 90%).
These features collectively move AI tool use from simple function calling towards intelligent orchestration.
Developers can strategically combine these features to address specific bottlenecks and enhance their AI agents.
The advanced tool use features are currently available in beta.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright podcast listeners, get ready for some exciting news from Anthropic! They've just unveiled three brand-new advanced tool-use features for their Claude AI models, and these are designed to seriously level up what AI agents can do in the real world. We're talking about the Tool Search Tool, Programmatic Tool Calling, and Tool Use Examples. These aren't just minor tweaks; they're solving some major headaches in AI tool integration, like when your AI's 'brain' (its context window) gets clogged with too much information, or when multi-step tasks become clunky, or even when the AI struggles to use a tool's parameters precisely. First up, the Tool Search Tool is a game-changer for handling vast libraries of tools. Instead of cramming every single tool definition into Claude's context upfront, which can gobble up tons of tokens, this feature lets Claude intelligently discover and load only the tools it needs for the task at hand. Think of it like a smart librarian only pulling out the books relevant to your immediate query. This can lead to a massive 85% reduction in token usage and makes Claude much more accurate when dealing with a huge array of tools. Next, we have Programmatic Tool Calling, and this is where things get really cool. Claude can now write and execute Python code in a secure environment to orchestrate complex workflows. This is a huge leap from simply calling tools one by one using natural language. By writing code, Claude can process tool outputs, apply logic like loops and conditionals, and filter what information actually makes it back into its main context. This means less token consumption, faster operations by cutting down on multiple inference passes, and much more accurate handling of intricate tasks. They even showed an example where Claude managed a budget check, processing thousands of expense items in code and only reporting back a concise summary. Finally, Tool Use Examples are all about precision. While standard JSON schemas are great for defining the structure of a tool, they often fall short in showing *how* to actually use it correctly—like what date format to use or which optional parameters make sense together. By embedding concrete examples directly into the tool definitions, Claude can learn these nuanced usage patterns. This has boosted parameter accuracy significantly, from 72% to a whopping 90%, preventing those frustrating malformed tool calls. Anthropic suggests strategically layering these features depending on your agent's biggest bottleneck. So, if your context window is getting bloated, grab the Tool Search Tool. If you're dealing with huge intermediate results, go for Programmatic Tool Calling. And if you're battling with parameter errors, Tool Use Examples are your friend. These fantastic new features are currently in beta, and they're really pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can achieve, moving us closer to truly intelligent orchestration across complex digital landscapes. I can't wait to see all the incredible things developers build with these advanced capabilities!
