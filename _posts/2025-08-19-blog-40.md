## Overview

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) now supports multi-subnet clusters, removing single-subnet limitations to improve scalability, resource utilization, and flexibility. Clusters running version 1.30.3-gke.1211000 or higher can add subnets on demand, allowing new node pools to use available IP space and avoid IP exhaustion errors.

## Key Points

- GKE now supports multi-subnet clusters, removing single-subnet limitations.
- Multi-subnet support improves scalability, resource utilization, and flexibility.
- Clusters running version 1.30.3-gke.1211000 or higher can add subnets on demand.
- New node pools can use available IP space and avoid IP exhaustion errors.

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) now supports multi-subnet clusters, removing single-subnet limitations to improve scalability, resource utilization, and flexibility. Clusters running version 1.30.3-gke.1211000 or higher can add subnets on demand, allowing new node pools to use available IP space and avoid IP exhaustion errors. Effective scaling strategies for OpenTofu include local development for learning, generic CI/CD pipelines for automation, open-source tools like Atlantis for GitOps workflows, and advanced orchestration platforms like Spacelift that provide integrated policy enforcement, drift detection, and multi-tool coordination.
