## Key Points

Companies typically never use over 95% of their data annotations, leading to significant budget waste on irrelevant data labeling
The workshop focuses on building feedback-driven annotation pipelines for perception models using FiftyOne platform
Key goal: Label fewer images for similar performance by moving away from inefficient random sampling strategies
Technique: Use zero-shot selection and embeddings to mathematically identify the most unique samples in datasets
Speed up QA by annotating and validating labels directly within FiftyOne using patch views for faster error correction
Build hybrid data selection strategy with 30% for diversity and 70% for targeting specific errors (balanced approach)
Implement rigorous workflow with frozen test set for final scores and separate golden set to catch label drift
Debug with embeddings to visualize specific clusters confusing the model rather than relying solely on performance metrics
Target audience: ML engineers, data scientists, AV/ADAS and robotics practitioners, computer vision researchers, and MLOps engineers
