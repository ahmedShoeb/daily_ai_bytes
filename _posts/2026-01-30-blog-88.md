## Key Points

- Enterprises will generate 317 zettabytes of data annually by 2028, with 78% unstructured.
- Traditional query tools only tap a tiny fraction of that data; AI query engines aim to use it all.
- An AI query engine connects AI agents to data, enabling natural‑language, context‑aware interactions.
- It can ingest structured, semi‑structured, and unstructured formats (PDFs, logs, images, video, etc.).
- Core capabilities include diverse data handling, petabyte‑scale scalability, high‑accuracy vector search, and continuous learning.
- Retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) lets generative models pull relevant knowledge from massive datasets during response generation.
- Real‑world use cases span AI‑powered virtual assistants, video summarization agents, vulnerability analysis tools, and research assistants.
- Companies like DataStax and NetApp are already building AI data platforms that act as query engines.
- NVIDIA Blueprints and the NVIDIA API catalog provide starter kits for building these engines.
- AI query engines create a feedback‑driven “AI data flywheel” that improves models and applications over time.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey folks, let’s dive into why AI query engines are becoming the backbone of enterprise AI. According to IDC, by 2028 companies will churn out a staggering 317 zettabytes of data each year, most of it unstructured – think audio, video, PDFs, logs, and more. Traditional databases and SQL‑style queries can’t keep up, so a new kind of engine is needed. An AI query engine is essentially a bridge that links AI agents to all that raw data, allowing them to understand natural‑language requests, pull relevant information, and respond in a conversational way. Unlike classic query tools that only work with tidy tables, these engines can ingest and index structured, semi‑structured, and unstructured content at petabyte scale, using embeddings, vector search, and reranking to retrieve the most accurate results. A key piece of the puzzle is Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG), which lets large language models tap into external knowledge bases during generation, turning policy manuals, videos, and technical docs into usable knowledge. The engine also learns continuously: feedback from AI‑driven applications feeds back into the system, refining embeddings and improving future responses – a self‑reinforcing AI data flywheel. Real‑world examples include AI virtual assistants that deliver 24/7 personalized support, agents that summarize video content, tools that scan code for vulnerabilities, and research assistants that sift through scientific literature. Companies like DataStax and NetApp are already rolling out AI data platforms that embed these capabilities, and NVIDIA offers Blueprint solutions and an API catalog to help enterprises get started quickly. In short, AI query engines unlock the hidden value in massive, messy data stores, empower smarter AI agents, and set the stage for a new era of data‑driven intelligence across the enterprise.
