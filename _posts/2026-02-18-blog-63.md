## Key Points

- The author introduces a generalized hill-climbing approach distinct from major AI labs' methods that combine pre-training and RL
- This approach focuses on creating 'Ideal State Criteria' - discrete, boolean, testable statements that define what 'done' looks like for any task
- The system uses two nested loops: an outer loop moving from current state to ideal state, and an inner loop implementing the scientific method/OODA loop
- Effort levels ranging from 'Instant' to 'Comprehensive' control the depth of processing, from simple typo fixes to complex system redesigns
- The Algorithm has been built into the PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) project running on Claude Code
- Verification involves checking each Ideal State Criterion against output in a binary pass/fail manner, with iteration until all criteria pass
- The approach works across domains including software, audio, photography, fitness, and more - making it truly generalized
- The author anticipates AI labs will adopt similar approaches in their agentic frameworks in 2026
