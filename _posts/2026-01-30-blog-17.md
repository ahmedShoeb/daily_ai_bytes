## Key Topics Discussed

Okay, so MeetKai is making a big splash in the wearable tech space! They're traditionally been focused on web-based metaverse experiences, but they’re now moving into hardware with their new AI operating system called Unified Wearables Intelligence, or UWI. This isn’t just any OS; it’s designed to be embedded directly into next-generation smart glasses and other wearables. The goal? To bring powerful augmented reality and AI capabilities to everyone, at more accessible price points. 

They’re working with hardware partners to make this happen, and one of the first products to utilize UWI is the Think AR AiLens Ultra.

It’s a really exciting blend of AI software and intelligent hardware.

But it’s not just about cool gadgets. MeetKai is also focusing on practical applications. They’ve partnered with Florida State University to create an immersive training platform for social work students, allowing them to practice their skills in realistic simulated environments. And, they’re working with Charlamagne tha God to build a new immersive entertainment world, full of social content, games, and opportunities for fans to connect. It seems like MeetKai is really committed to democratizing access to immersive technologies and showing how AI can be both innovative and inclusive.
