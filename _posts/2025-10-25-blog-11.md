## Key Points

World Models (WMs) can simulate visually realistic worlds, but their practical utility for embodied agents in decision-making has been limited by open-loop evaluations focusing on visual quality.
The 'World-in-World' platform is introduced as the first comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for WMs, directly assessing their ability to help agents succeed at embodied tasks.
It provides a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling the evaluation of diverse WMs in realistic agent-environment interactions.
The study identifies three key findings: (1) visual quality alone doesn't guarantee task success; controllability is more crucial, (2) scaling WMs post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading pre-trained video generators, and (3) increasing inference-time compute substantially improves closed-loop performance.
The platform includes four carefully designed benchmark tasks to evaluate the utility of visual world models in a closed-loop setting.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright podcast listeners, today we're diving into some fascinating research that's tackling a big question in AI: Can those incredibly realistic generative world models actually help embodied agents make better decisions? A new platform called 'World-in-World' is shaking things up by introducing the first comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for these visual world models. 

See, traditionally, evaluations have really focused on how good these models are at simulating visually, almost like watching a high-definition movie. But what about their actual usefulness when an AI agent needs to interact with and make decisions within that simulated world? 'World-in-World' steps in to bridge this gap, moving beyond just visual quality to prioritize actual task success. 

This platform offers a unified way for different world models to plan and act, and it includes four specifically designed tasks to put them through their paces. And guess what? The findings are pretty eye-opening! It turns out, simply having a visually stunning world model doesn't guarantee success; what truly matters is its controllability. Plus, they discovered that it's more effective to scale these models with real action-observation data *after* training, rather than just trying to make the initial video generators better. And for those tech enthusiasts, more compute during inference time can seriously boost performance. This 'World-in-World' benchmark is a huge step forward for systematically evaluating world models and pushing the boundaries of embodied AI.
