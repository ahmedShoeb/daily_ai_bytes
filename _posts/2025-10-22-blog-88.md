## Key Points

- OpenAI researchers claimed GPT-5 solved 10 previously unsolved Erdős problems and made progress on 11 others.
- Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis criticized OpenAI's claims.
- Mathematician Thomas Bloom clarified that GPT-5 found existing solutions in the literature he was unaware of, not truly unsolved problems.
- OpenAI researcher Sebastien Bubeck later admitted that only solutions in the literature were found, though he still highlighted the difficulty of literature search.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright, folks, let's dive into some interesting news from the world of AI that's causing a bit of a stir! It seems OpenAI had a little bit of an 'oopsie' moment when celebrating GPT-5's supposed mathematical breakthroughs. Initially, their VP, Kevin Weil, excitedly announced that GPT-5 had managed to solve ten previously unsolved Erdős problems and even made progress on eleven others. Now, that sounds pretty amazing, right? But hold your horses, because not everyone was buying it. Yann LeCun from Meta and Demis Hassabis from Google DeepMind were quick to call out the claims, with LeCun even quipping, 'Hoisted by their own GPTards.' Ouch! It turns out, mathematician Thomas Bloom, who actually maintains the Erdős Problems website, clarified that while these problems were listed as 'open' on his site, it just meant he personally wasn't aware of a published solution. So, GPT-5 didn't actually solve new, never-before-cracked problems, but rather found existing solutions that Bloom himself hadn't encountered yet. An OpenAI researcher, Sebastien Bubeck, later acknowledged this, admitting that 'only solutions in the literature were found.' While he still tried to frame it as an accomplishment, it's clear the initial fanfare was a bit overstated, leading to what some are calling an 'embarrassing' moment for OpenAI. It just goes to show you, even in the fast-paced world of AI, a little bit of fact-checking goes a long way!
