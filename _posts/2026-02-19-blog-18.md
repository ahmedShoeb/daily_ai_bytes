## Key Points

Manus is launching Manus Agents, a personal AI agent available inside messaging apps like Telegram
The solution eliminates complex setup and maintenance, allowing users to focus on what the agent can do
Users can connect in seconds via QR code without command lines, configuration files, or API tokens
The agent supports multi-step tasks, research, data processing, reports, and PDF generation
Supports voice messages, images, and files - can transcribe, understand intent, and generate outputs
Users can set communication styles (concise, structured, conversational) and choose between two models
Manus 1.6 Max is optimized for complex reasoning and creative work while Manus 1.6 Lite is faster for everyday tasks
Real-world use cases include meeting prep, creative profile image generation, and product content creation
The agent only accesses messages sent directly to it and cannot read other Telegram conversations
Telegram is the first supported platform with more messaging apps coming soon
