## Key Points

Dolphin 3.0 Llama 3.1 8B is a new general-purpose open-source model designed for coding, math, and agentic tasks.
The model is based on Meta's Llama-3.1-8B and follows the 'Dolphin' philosophy of being steerable and uncensored.
Users have total control over the system prompt and alignment, with no built-in ethical filters imposed by the creators.
It was curated and trained by Eric Hartford, Ben Gitter, and the Cognitive Computations team.
The model uses the ChatML template for interactions and supports tools like Ollama and LM Studio for easy local deployment.
Training involved a diverse set of datasets including OpenCoder, Orca, and Tulu-3.sft-mixture.
Notable sponsors like Crusoe Cloud and Akash provided the high-end compute power (L40s and H100s) needed for training.
The model aims to solve issues found in commercial models, such as silent version changes and lack of data privacy.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! We've got some exciting news from the world of open-source AI. Cognitive Computations has just dropped Dolphin 3.0, specifically the Llama 3.1 8B version, and it's looking like a total game-changer for local model enthusiasts. 

Dolphin 3.0 is designed to be the ultimate general-purpose tool that you can run right on your own machine. Whether you're into coding, tackling complex math, or building agentic workflows with function calling, this model is built to handle it all. What really sets Dolphin apart is its philosophy of being 'uncensored' and completely steerable. Unlike the big corporate models that might change their rules or filter your queries, Dolphin is designed to be an extension of your own will. You get to decide the alignment and set the system prompt to match exactly what you need, without the model imposing its own ethics on you. 

The team, led by Eric Hartford, used a massive variety of datasets to train this beast, including work from Microsoft, NousResearch, and Meta. It uses the ChatML format and is super easy to get running with tools like Ollama or LM Studio. If you're looking for a model where you're truly in the driver's seat of your data and your AI's behavior, Dolphin 3.0 is definitely one to check out!
