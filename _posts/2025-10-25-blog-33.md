## Key Points

OpenAI reportedly sent a sheriff's deputy to the home of Nathan Calvin, an AI regulation advocate from Encode AI, to serve him a subpoena.
The subpoena requested Calvin's private messages with various individuals and organizations, including California legislators and former OpenAI employees.
Calvin believes OpenAI used its lawsuit against Elon Musk as a pretext to intimidate critics and imply Musk's involvement.
Encode AI advocates for AI safety and supported California's SB 53, a bill compelling AI companies to reveal safety and security processes.
Tyler Johnston, founder of The Midas Project, also reported receiving similar subpoenas from OpenAI, despite his organization having no direct involvement in the Musk lawsuit.
OpenAI's chief strategy officer, Aaron Kwon, stated the subpoenas were to understand why Encode joined Elon Musk's legal challenge.
The Midas Project's chief of staff, Jack Kelly, refuted Kwon's justification, highlighting their lack of involvement in the legal case.
Joshua Achiam, OpenAI's head of mission alignment, publicly expressed concern on X, stating, "this doesn't seem great."

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey podcast listeners, buckle up because we've got some interesting news coming out of the AI world that raises some serious questions about advocacy and corporate behavior. It seems OpenAI, a major player in artificial intelligence, is facing accusations of attempting to intimidate AI regulation advocates. Nathan Calvin, a lawyer with Encode AI, claims a sheriff's deputy appeared at his door to serve him a personal subpoena from OpenAI. The subpoena allegedly demanded private messages Calvin had with various individuals, including legislators and former OpenAI employees. Calvin views this as an attempt by OpenAI to use its ongoing legal battle with Elon Musk as a smokescreen to silence its critics and imply Musk is behind their advocacy. Encode AI, for its part, has been vocal about AI safety, even pushing for California's landmark AI bill, SB 53, which aims to make large AI companies more transparent about their safety protocols. Adding to the controversy, Tyler Johnston, the founder of The Midas Project, reported receiving similar subpoenas from OpenAI, despite his organization having no direct involvement in the lawsuit against Musk. OpenAI's chief strategy officer, Aaron Kwon, responded by saying their goal was to understand why Encode chose to join Musk's legal challenge, but The Midas Project's chief of staff, Jack Kelly, quickly pushed back, pointing out their group's lack of involvement. Even Joshua Achiam, OpenAI's head of mission alignment, publicly voiced his concern on X, remarking that 'this doesn't seem great.' This situation certainly highlights the growing tensions around AI regulation and the methods companies might employ when faced with scrutiny.
