## Key Topics Discussed

Folks, we have some absolutely massive AI funding news today - Anthropic has just raised a staggering $30 billion in Series G funding, valuing the company at a whopping $380 billion post-money. This round was led by GIC and Coatue, with co-leadership from D. E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, and it includes a who's who of Silicon Valley's biggest names - we're talking Accel, Sequoia, General Catalyst, and even portions of those previously announced Microsoft and NVIDIA investments.

Now here's what's truly remarkable - Anthropic only earned its first dollar in revenue less than three years ago, and today they're boasting a run-rate revenue of $14 billion, growing over 10x annually in each of those three years. That's the kind of hockey stick growth curve that makes venture capitalists absolutely giddy.

What's driving this insane growth? Well, Anthropic has positioned itself as the intelligence platform of choice for enterprises. Eight of the Fortune 10 companies are now Claude customers, and get this - two years ago they only had a dozen customers spending over $1 million annually. Today that number exceeds 500. That's just mind-boggling growth.

But the real star of the show here is Claude Code. Since being made available to the general public in May 2025, Claude Code's run-rate revenue has grown to over $2.5 billion - more than doubling since the beginning of 2026. A recent analysis found that 4% of all GitHub public commits worldwide are being authored by Claude Code, and that's double the percentage from just one month prior.

Enterprise adoption is exploding too - business subscriptions to Claude Code have quadrupled since the start of 2026, and enterprise use now represents over half of all Claude Code revenue. And Anthropic isn't resting on their laurels - in January alone they launched more than thirty products and features, including Cowork, which brings Claude Code's powerful engineering capabilities to a broader scope of knowledge work tasks with eleven open-source plugins.

On the technical front, Anthropic just launched Opus 4.6 last week, which they claim can power agents that manage entire categories of real-world work, generating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations with professional polish. They're also leading the world on the GDPval-AA benchmark, which measures performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal, and other domains.

What I find particularly interesting from an infrastructure perspective is that Claude remains the only frontier AI model available on all three major cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. They're training and running Claude on a diversified range of AI hardware - AWS Trainium, Google TPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs - which gives them flexibility and resilience.

This $30 billion funding round is going to fuel even more frontier research, product development, and infrastructure expansion. Anthropic's CFO Krishna Rao says the message from customers - whether entrepreneurs, startups, or the world's largest enterprises - is that Claude is increasingly becoming critical to how businesses work, and this fundraising reflects the incredible demand they're seeing.

We're clearly seeing AI move from experimentation to scaled implementation, and Anthropic seems perfectly positioned to lead that transition with this massive war chest and their growing enterprise foothold.
