## Key Topics Discussed

Hey podcast listeners, have you heard the latest buzz from OpenAI? It looks like they might be stepping into the music world! According to a report from The Information, OpenAI is reportedly developing an exciting new generative music tool. This tool would have the ability to create music based on both text and audio prompts. Imagine the possibilities â€“ you could use it to add background music to your videos or even generate a guitar accompaniment for your vocal tracks. While we don't have a clear timeline for its release or whether it will be a standalone product or integrated with existing tools like ChatGPT and Sora, it's definitely something to keep an eye on. Interestingly, the report also suggests that OpenAI is working with students from the Juilliard School to annotate scores, which sounds like they're gathering some high-quality training data.
