## Key Topics Discussed

The article 'OpenAI growth rebounds following GPT-5 launch' analyzes the business adoption trends of OpenAI's tools after the release of GPT-5. Despite acknowledging that the GPT-5 launch was perceived as 'botched' and even led to an apology from Sam Altman, the data from Ramp AI Index indicates a significant rebound in business adoption. The report highlights a 1.5% increase in businesses subscribing to OpenAI models and tools in August 2025, suggesting that the initial rollout issues did not deter long-term adoption. Notably, OpenAI's growth in adoption is now outpacing its main rival, Anthropic, marking a reversal of trends observed earlier in the summer. The finance and manufacturing sectors emerged as the fastest-growing adopters of new AI spend, with increases of 3% and 2% respectively. This expansion into manufacturing suggests that GPT-5's enhanced reasoning and efficiency capabilities are broadening AI's appeal to industries traditionally slower in technology adoption. The article also touches upon the author's use of first-party data from Ramp to provide unique insights into business spending on AI, and briefly mentions other players in the AI race like xAI and Anthropic. Overall, it paints a picture of resilient growth for OpenAI, driven by the capabilities of its latest model despite initial challenges.
