## Key Points

OpenAI has fixed ChatGPT's tendency to use em dashes.
The em dash has become a recognizable sign of AI-generated text, leading to criticism.
Previously, users couldn't prevent ChatGPT from using em dashes even when asked.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the fix on X, calling it a "small-but-happy win."
Users can now instruct ChatGPT to avoid em dashes using custom instructions in personalization settings.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright, podcast listeners, get ready for a little bit of a grammar victory! OpenAI has finally tackled a rather persistent and, frankly, sometimes annoying issue with ChatGPT: its love affair with the em dash. For months, that little dash has been popping up everywhere, from school papers to LinkedIn posts, almost becoming a tell-tale sign that AI had a hand in the writing. And let's be honest, it led to some eye-rolls and accusations of laziness. 

Turns out, even when you explicitly told ChatGPT, 'Hey, no em dashes, please!' it just couldn't resist. But fear not! OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself announced on X that the problem is fixed. He called it a "small-but-happy win," and honestly, we agree! So, if you're tired of that omnipresent punctuation, you can now head into your custom instructions in ChatGPT's personalization settings and tell it to ditch the em dashes. Finally, a little more control over our AI-generated text!
