## Key Points

Google is developing a multi-agent system within Gemini for Enterprise for automated research.
This system can work on a single problem for approximately 40 minutes, generating and evaluating about 100 ideas in a tournament style.
Users receive ranked ideas with detailed overviews, reviews, and performance reports.
Two key agents, 'Idea Generation' and 'Co-scientist,' utilize this multi-agent workflow for general idea generation and scientific research.
The system allocates substantial compute, marking a significant advancement in agentic AI capabilities.
Another agent, 'chat with your docs,' allows users to upload and interact with PDF documents up to 30 MB.
These features are currently in development within Gemini for Enterprise and are not yet publicly available.
The multi-agent tournament setup is considered a breakthrough product direction for LLM providers.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! Today, we've got some exciting news from Google about some major advancements coming to Gemini for Enterprise. It looks like Google is working on a really innovative multi-agent system designed to automate research and idea generation. This isn't just a quick task; this system can actually dedicate around 40 minutes to a single problem, generating a huge pool of roughly 100 ideas. And here's the cool part: it then spins up a team of agents to evaluate these ideas in a tournament style, ranking them from best to worst based on chosen criteria. You'll get detailed overviews, reviews, and performance reports for each idea, giving users a comprehensive look.

Currently, we're seeing previews of three agents, with two of them leveraging this powerful multi-agent tournament system. The first is 'Idea Generation,' where you just provide a topic, and it goes to work generating and ranking ideas. The second, 'Co-scientist,' is geared more towards researchers, allowing them to specify a research topic and provide data for idea generation and evaluation, all through that same tournament mechanism.

What's truly impressive is the amount of compute power Google is allocating here. Forty minutes for a single task is quite a leap compared to typical agentic tools, allowing for sustained iteration on a problem. This really aligns with the concept of 'Level 3 AI,' where agents can work on problems for extended periods.

Beyond these tournament-based systems, there's also an agent called 'chat with your docs.' This will let enterprise users upload PDFs up to 30 megabytes and have a direct conversation with their documents, extracting valuable insights from existing content.

While these features are still in development and not yet publicly available within Gemini for Enterprise, they represent a significant step forward. The multi-agent tournament setup, in particular, seems like a breakthrough product direction that could set a new standard for LLM providers. We'll definitely be keeping a close eye on when these powerful agents might ship and how they'll impact organizations and research teams!
