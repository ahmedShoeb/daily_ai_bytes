## Key Points

AMD and OpenAI announced an expanded partnership where OpenAI will purchase billions in chips.
OpenAI will pay for these purchases using stock warrants granted by AMD, potentially up to 160 million shares.
These warrants will vest as AMD's stock price hits certain milestones, with a potential value of $100 billion if the stock reaches $600 per share.
Analysts believe OpenAI will likely sell the AMD stock over time to finance its chip purchases, effectively making it a financing scheme by AMD.
The deal is seen as a major validation for AMD's AI GPUs, which could accelerate adoption with other customers and cloud service providers.
While 
arguably less attractive
 than Nvidia's investment approach, the deal secures AMD a significant foothold (up to 30% market share) in the next-generation data center build-out.
The ultimate cost of this financing gambit will be borne by retail and institutional investors who bid up AMD's stock.

## Key Topics Discussed

AMD and OpenAI have announced an expanded partnership for chip purchases, with an unusual payment structure where OpenAI will use AMD's own stock to finance the deal. AMD has granted OpenAI up to 160 million stock warrants, which will vest in tranches based on AMD's stock price reaching specific milestones, potentially allowing OpenAI to cover billions in chip costs by selling appreciated AMD shares. This agreement involves OpenAI assisting AMD in refining its Instinct GPUs and committing to deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over several years. Wall Street analysts view this arrangement as AMD essentially financing its customer's purchases, with OpenAI likely selling the vested stock to pay its bill. Despite the unconventional financing, analysts highlight the immense value for AMD in gaining validation for its AI GPUs, which could significantly accelerate adoption among other customers and cloud service providers. The deal is considered a major strategic move for AMD, securing a substantial foothold—potentially up to 30% market share—in the booming market for next-generation data centers. While differing from Nvidia's strategy of investing in OpenAI to gain a stake, AMD's approach, though
