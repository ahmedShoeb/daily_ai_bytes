## Key Points

- Author details their evolving workflow for using LLMs (Claude) to decompile Nintendo 64 game Snowboard Kids 2
- Initially made rapid progress from 25% to 58% matched code, but progress slowed dramatically
- Shifted from difficulty-based prioritization to similarity-based scheduling using function similarity analysis
- Used Coddog tool for computing Levenshtein distance over opcode sequences to find similar functions
- Specialized tooling like gfxdis.f3dex2 for graphics microcode and documentation skills proved crucial
- Permuters (tools that brute-force small mutations) were removed due to producing noisy, hard-to-clean code
- Cleaner, more idiomatic code matches improved Claude's ability to reference similar functions
- Implemented worktrees for concurrent agents, agent hooks to prevent destructive actions, and Nigel the Cat for task orchestration
- Used GLM (z.ai's open-weight model) via 'glaude' wrapper for mechanical tasks to conserve Opus tokens
- Currently stuck at ~75% decompilation with 124 remaining unmatched functions out of original 157
- Remaining challenges: large functions (1000+ instructions), graphics-heavy display list macros, and complex math functions
