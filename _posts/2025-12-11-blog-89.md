## Key Points

NVIDIA's Q3 Fiscal 2026 earnings show record revenue, but financial analysis reveals potential 
red flags
including a cash flow mystery, increased inventory, and extended Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).
Concerns about 
circular financing
 or 
round-tripping
 are discussed, involving NVIDIA's investments in OpenAI, OpenAI's contract with Oracle, and Oracle's subsequent GPU orders from NVIDIA, with regulators reportedly investigating.
OpenAI is actively working to reduce its dependency on NVIDIA by developing its own custom hardware through 
Project Stargate
, direct DRAM wafer purchases, and hiring key silicon talent from companies like Google and Apple.
The article suggests Oracle should consider acquiring Groq, a startup offering faster and cheaper inference using SRAM, as a strategic move to bypass HBM shortages, reduce 
NVIDIA Tax
, and gain a competitive edge in inference for its clients like OpenAI.
The complex and evolving dynamics between NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Oracle hint at a heated AI hardware market with significant strategic maneuvers and potential conflicts of interest.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, let's dive deep into a fascinating report that explores the intricate and, dare I say, 'frenemy' relationship between NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Oracle. While NVIDIA's recent Q3 Fiscal 2026 earnings report boasts incredible revenue growth and CEO Jensen Huang's 'virtuous cycle of AI,' our author, after a thorough balance sheet analysis, points out some intriguing 'red flags.'

For instance, despite a massive net income, there's an $8 billion gap in operating cash flow, meaning profits aren't immediately converting to cash. Inventory has nearly doubled to almost $20 billion, which, while management attributes it to the upcoming 'Blackwell' launch, seems like a significant capital drain. Plus, NVIDIA's Days Sales Outstanding have crept up to 53 days, suggesting they might be extending substantial credit to enterprise clients to keep that revenue flywheel spinning.

Now, let's talk about the 'round-tripping' theories that even financial guru Michael Burry has been tweeting about. The article maps out a potential 'web' of deals: NVIDIA reportedly pledges billions to OpenAI, OpenAI then signs a massive cloud contract with Oracle, and Oracle, in turn, places huge orders for NVIDIA's GPUs. The big question here is whether this revenue is truly organic or if it's interdependent, raising concerns about 'circular financing.'

What's super interesting is OpenAI's strategic shift. They're clearly working to lessen their reliance on NVIDIA. We're seeing moves like 'Project Stargate,' a massive infrastructure plan that includes custom hardware, direct DRAM wafer purchases from Samsung and SK Hynix, bypassing NVIDIA's supply chain, and even poaching top silicon talent from tech giants like Google and Apple. The speculation is that OpenAI aims to use NVIDIA GPUs for training but then run inference on their own custom silicon to cut costs.

Then there's the compelling case for Oracle to acquire Groq, a startup that claims to offer faster and cheaper inference than NVIDIA, particularly relevant given the current HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) shortage. Groq's architecture uses SRAM, which isn't facing the same supply chain crunch as HBM. Such an acquisition could be a game-changer for Oracle, reducing their 'NVIDIA Tax,' improving margins, and providing a crucial supply chain hedge, especially for a key client like OpenAI.

As we look ahead, the dynamics between these tech titans are undeniably complex. There are open questions about NVIDIA's awareness of OpenAI's direct wafer deals, potential collusion, and NVIDIA's fight for exclusivity in training and inference. Michael Burry is betting against the whole thing, but regardless of speculation, one thing is clear: the AI hardware market is absolutely buzzing, and the coming quarters are going to be incredibly exciting to watch! It's a true high-stakes chess match playing out in real-time.
