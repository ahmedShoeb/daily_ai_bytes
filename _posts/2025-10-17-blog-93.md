## Key Points

- Nvidia introduced its vision for 'gigawatt AI factories' utilizing the Vera Rubin architecture at the 2025 OCP Global Summit.
- These AI factories will be based on the Vera Rubin NVL144, a 100% liquid-cooled, open architecture rack server designed for next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs, expected in 2027.
- Nvidia is donating the Vera Rubin NVL144 architecture to the Open Compute Project as an open standard.
- The Vera Rubin NVL144 features a central printed circuit board midplane and modular expansion bays for enhanced scalability and ease of assembly.
- Nvidia also showcased the Kyber server rack design, which can connect 576 Rubin Ultra GPUs and features 800 VDC power delivery for increased energy efficiency.
- Meta Platforms Inc. and Oracle Corp. announced plans to standardize their data centers on Nvidia’s Spectrum-X Ethernet networking switches.
- Spectrum-X Ethernet switches are designed to deliver immediate performance gains for AI workloads through higher-speed connectivity and optimized data flow.

## Key Topics Discussed

Nvidia Corp. has unveiled its ambitious vision for 'gigawatt AI factories,' which are next-generation data centers optimized for artificial intelligence workloads. This initiative is built around the company's Vera Rubin architecture, with Nvidia collaborating with over 70 partners. A key component of this vision is the Vera Rubin NVL144, an open architecture, 100% liquid-cooled rack server designed to support the upcoming Vera Rubin graphics processing units, slated for a 2027 launch. This architecture is being donated to the Open Compute Project as an open standard, allowing other companies to implement it in their data centers. It features a central printed circuit board midplane for faster assembly and modular expansion bays for scaling networking and inference capabilities. 

Nvidia also highlighted growing support for its Kyber server rack design, which will eventually connect 576 Rubin Ultra GPUs. The Kyber architecture incorporates innovations in 800 VDC power delivery, liquid cooling, and mechanical design to enhance AI energy efficiency and support increased rack GPU density. This 800 VDC system is capable of transmitting 150% more power through the same copper wires compared to traditional systems. 

Further boosting Nvidia's standing, Meta Platforms Inc. and Oracle Corp. have announced their intentions to standardize their data centers on Nvidia’s Spectrum-X Ethernet networking switches. These switches are crucial for delivering immediate performance gains for AI workloads by providing higher-speed connectivity and enhanced data throughput. Meta plans to integrate Spectrum-X switches into its Facebook Open Switching System, while Oracle will adopt them for both existing and future gigawatt-scale AI factories. These developments underscore Nvidia's commitment to building a robust and scalable infrastructure for the future of AI.
