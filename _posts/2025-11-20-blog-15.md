## Key Points

Grok 4.1 has been released and is now available across grok.com, 𝕏, and its mobile apps.
The new model offers significant enhancements in creative, emotional, and collaborative interactions, being more perceptive and coherent.
It was optimized using large-scale reinforcement learning for style, personality, helpfulness, and alignment.
Grok 4.1 was preferred in blind human preference evaluations 64.78% of the time compared to its predecessor.
It holds the #1 position in LMArena's Text Arena with 1483 Elo and shows strong performance in emotional intelligence (EQ-Bench3) and creative writing (Creative Writing v3) benchmarks.
The update also includes significant reductions in factual hallucinations for information-seeking prompts, improving reliability.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, exciting news from xAI! Grok 4.1 is officially out and available to all users on grok.com, 𝕏, and their iOS and Android apps. This isn't just a minor update; Grok 4.1 brings some pretty significant improvements to how we can interact with it in the real world.

The xAI team has focused on making Grok 4.1 exceptionally capable in creative, emotional, and collaborative interactions. It's designed to be more perceptive to nuanced intent, more compelling to speak with, and much more coherent in its personality, all while keeping that razor-sharp intelligence we've come to expect. They achieved this by applying their large-scale reinforcement learning infrastructure, similar to what powered Grok 4, specifically to optimize the model's style, personality, helpfulness, and overall alignment. They even developed new methods using frontier agentic reasoning models to autonomously evaluate and iterate on responses at scale, which is pretty cutting-edge!

During a two-week silent rollout, Grok 4.1 was put through continuous blind pairwise evaluations on live traffic, and the results are impressive. It was preferred 64.78% of the time compared to the previous production model. This new standard in blind human preference evaluations really speaks volumes about its enhanced capabilities.

If you're into leaderboards, you'll be interested to know that Grok 4.1, specifically its "Thinking" mode (codename: quasarflux), holds the #1 overall position in LMArena's Text Arena with a commanding 1483 Elo. Even its non-reasoning mode (codename: tensor) ranks #2, surpassing every other model’s full-reasoning configuration on the public leaderboard. This is a huge leap from Grok 4, which was at #33.

Beyond raw intelligence, xAI also measured progress on Grok's personality and interpersonal abilities. It performed strongly on EQ-Bench3, a test that evaluates active emotional intelligence, understanding, insight, empathy, and interpersonal skills through challenging roleplay scenarios. The examples provided show a marked improvement in its empathetic responses to emotional prompts.

Creative writing also saw a boost, with Grok 4.1 excelling in the Creative Writing v3 benchmark. The examples here demonstrate a much more nuanced and engaging writing style, showcasing its ability to generate compelling and imaginative text.

Finally, a major focus for Grok 4.1 post-training was reducing factual hallucinations, especially for information-seeking prompts. The team has observed significant reductions in hallucination rates on real-world queries and improved its FActScore. This means you can expect more reliable and accurate information from Grok 4.1. So, get ready to experience a more intelligent, empathetic, and creative Grok!
