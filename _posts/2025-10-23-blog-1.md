## Key Points

App installs for Meta AI also rose to 300,000 new downloads per day, up from under 200,000 daily.
This sharp rise correlates with the launch of Meta's new "Vibes" feed on September 25, which introduced short-form AI-generated videos to the app.
The attention surrounding OpenAI's Sora video generator might have also indirectly boosted Meta AI, as users who couldn't access Sora may have sought alternatives.
Meta AI experienced a 15.58% increase in worldwide daily active users as of October 17, while competitors like ChatGPT, Grok, and Perplexity saw declines.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! We've got some interesting news about Meta AI today. It seems their mobile app for iOS and Android has experienced a pretty massive surge in activity recently. We're talking about daily active users jumping to 2.7 million as of October 17th, a big leap from just 775,000 a mere four weeks before that! And it's not just existing users; new app installs are also up, hitting around 300,000 downloads daily. What's behind this sudden explosion of interest? Well, a big factor seems to be the launch of Meta's new 'Vibes' feed back on September 25th. This new feature brought short-form, AI-generated videos right into the Meta AI mobile app, and it looks like users are really enjoying it. It's a clear indicator that people are eager to explore and create with AI-powered tools directly within their social platforms. Interestingly, there's also a possibility that the buzz around OpenAI's Sora video generator might have played a role, even though Sora is invite-only. It's speculated that users who couldn't get access to Sora might have turned to Meta AI as an alternative to experiment with AI video generation. This suggests that sometimes, even a competitor's exclusive launch can inadvertently benefit others in the space. This growth is particularly noteworthy when you look at the broader landscape. While Meta AI saw a healthy 15.58% increase in its worldwide daily active users, some of its rivals like ChatGPT, Grok, and Perplexity actually experienced declines in the same period. It really highlights Meta's strategic push into AI and its ability to capture user attention with new, engaging features.
