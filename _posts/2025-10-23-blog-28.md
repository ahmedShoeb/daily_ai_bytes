## Key Topics Discussed

Hey podcast listeners! Get ready for some exciting news from Adobe! The creative design giant is stepping up its game, offering businesses the chance to build their very own custom generative AI models. They've just launched Adobe AI Foundry, a brand-new service designed to help enterprises create tailored AI models, all trained on their unique branding and intellectual property. Imagine generating text, images, video, and even 3D scenes that are perfectly aligned with your brand's voice and style! These custom models are built on Adobe's existing Firefly family of AI models, which, for those of you keeping track, were launched in 2023 and are famously trained on fully licensed data. Adobe then takes these powerful Firefly models and fine-tunes them specifically for each customer, leveraging their proprietary content. And here's a fresh twist: the pricing for the Foundry service is usage-based, a departure from Adobe's usual seat-based model. Hannah Elsakr, Adobe's VP of generative AI new business ventures, highlighted that this is a natural evolution, driven by customer demand for more customization. She pointed out that businesses have already used Firefly models to create over 25 billion assets since 2023! The goal is to empower brands to maintain consistent and personalized advertising campaigns, effortlessly adapting content for different seasons, languages, or formats. But don't worry, creatives, Adobe is clear: they're not looking to replace human creativity. Instead, they see the Foundry as another advanced tool in the toolkit, designed to uplift narratives and help you execute your creative vision with even greater power. It's all about putting the brand directly into the consumer's hand, in a truly on-brand way, making personalized commerce a reality through generative AI.
