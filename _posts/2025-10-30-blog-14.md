## Key Points

Google announced a Gemma model helped discover a new potential cancer therapy pathway, leading to claims of AI generating novel science.
The 'discovery' was a complex pipeline involving significant human input, not an autonomous AI finding.
Humans designed the entire experiment, including architecture, data, and proposed targets, and performed crucial steps like candidate selection and hypothesis formulation.
Gemma LLMs were used to process and predict gene-expression profiles and probabilistically narrow down a large dataset of drug candidates for human inspection.
The article argues that AI served as a productivity enhancement for a narrow task, not as a 'thinking machine' or an advancement towards AGI.
The author suggests AI's best use is in research with defined tasks, rather than generating 'hallucinated noise.'

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright, podcast listeners, get ready for a deep dive into a headline that's been making waves: 'AI Discovers Novel Cancer Drug, or Did It?' This article unpacks Google's exciting announcement about a Gemma model assisting in a potential cancer therapy discovery, but it cleverly asks us to look beyond the hype. It turns out, this wasn't an instance of AI independently thinking up a cure. Instead, it was a highly structured, human-designed process where large language models, like Gemma, played a very specific role.

Here's the gist: human scientists were the masterminds behind the entire experiment, from designing the architecture to setting up the data and identifying the targets. The Gemma model, after being extensively trained and fine-tuned by humans, was used to process massive amounts of genetic data and make probabilistic predictions about drug interactions. Think of it as an incredibly powerful filtering system, sifting through millions of possibilities to present a manageable list.

But the critical steps—like selecting the most promising candidates, formulating hypotheses about their biological action, and even verifying them in the lab—were all performed by humans. The article emphasizes that while AI significantly boosted productivity by narrowing down the field, it didn't engage in reasoning or independent scientific thought. It was a tool, albeit a very sophisticated one, for pattern recognition and data processing. The author makes a compelling argument that this is actually a far better and more effective use of AI in research, rather than letting it generate unverified information. So, while it's a fantastic achievement for drug discovery, it's a testament to human ingenuity leveraging powerful AI tools, not AI acting as an autonomous 'thinking machine.'
