## Key Points

Anthropic has excellent aesthetics, storytelling, and product quality (Claude) with stellar retention, but struggles with consumer marketing
The company's story isn't widely heard or legible to the general public despite their narrative strengths
Root issue is 'legibility and micro-empathy' - Anthropic employees feel intellectually distant from average consumers
Compares this to philosopher-king mindset, similar to Elon Musk's relationship with humanity but with intellectual 'othering'
Super Bowl ad was criticized as unintelligible, not eye-catching, and talking about 'AI without ads' which isn't a consumer pain point
Proposes alternative ad concept with Clawd mascots building rockets/code to show 'country of geniuses in a data center' vision
Suggests Anthropic should sell a future narrative, not just compare products or features
Notes that post-ironic advertising (like Budweiser's Super Bowl ad) works better for modern audiences than direct messaging
