## Key Points

- Character AI is adding two new web‑based games, Speakeasy and War of Words, to its platform.
- Games are available to paid subscribers and a limited free‑plan audience, aiming to boost engagement.
- Speakeasy challenges users to get a chatbot to say a target word without using five forbidden words.
- War of Words pits the user against a character in a five‑round duel judged by an AI referee.
- The move signals Character AI’s shift toward a broader entertainment focus, not just AI companionship.
- Leadership changes: former co‑founders left for Google; a YouTube exec became CPO and the former counsel is interim CEO.
- The company emphasizes safety upgrades, especially for teen users, after past lawsuits.
- Analytics show users spend an average of 98 minutes per day on the app, so games could keep them longer.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey folks, let’s dive into what’s new at Character AI. The startup, known for letting you chat with a variety of AI‑powered personalities, is now testing two fresh games on its desktop and mobile web apps. Think of it as a way to keep users glued to the platform for longer. The games—Speakeasy and War of Words—are currently a perk for paid subscribers and a select group of free‑plan users.

Speakeasy is a word‑play challenge. You pick a target word, say “croissant,” and the bot has to say it without using any of five banned words like pastry, butter, bake, French, or flaky. It’s a fun test of the AI’s linguistic flexibility. War of Words, on the other hand, is a quick duel: you go head‑to‑head with a character over five rounds, and an AI referee decides who wins each round.

Why the games? Character AI’s spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company wants to be more than just an AI companion service—it wants to be a full‑blown entertainment platform. By adding interactive content, they hope to keep users spending more time on the app, which already averages 98 minutes per day per user.

The company’s leadership has seen a shake‑up: co‑founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas moved to Google, a former YouTube executive joined as chief product officer, and Dominic Perella, once the company’s general counsel, stepped in as interim CEO. Under this new direction, Character AI is doubling down on safety, especially for teens, after a series of lawsuits highlighted the need for clearer labeling and time‑out features.

In short, Character AI is testing the waters of gamification to boost engagement and reinforce its brand as an entertainment hub. If the games hit the mark, we might see more AI‑powered interactive experiences popping up across the web.
