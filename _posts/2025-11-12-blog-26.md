## Key Points

OpenAI is committing an astonishing $1.15 trillion to hardware and cloud infrastructure between 2025 and 2035.
This massive investment is spread across seven major vendors: Broadcom ($350B), Oracle ($300B), Microsoft ($250B), Nvidia ($100B), AMD ($90B), Amazon AWS ($38B), and CoreWeave ($22B).
Annual compute spending is projected to skyrocket from $6 billion in 2025 to $173 billion in 2029, and reach $295 billion by 2030.
OpenAI anticipates its gross profit margin to improve significantly, from 48% in 2025 to 70% by 2029.
To support this level of spending, OpenAI's implied revenue would need to grow from an estimated ~$10 billion in 2024 to $577 billion by 2029, a scale comparable to Google's revenue in the same period.
The article highlights the complexity of accounting, differentiating between hardware manufacturing (capitalized and depreciated) and cloud services (immediate COGS expenses).
Key contracts include Broadcom for custom AI accelerators, Microsoft for Azure services, Oracle for cloud infrastructure as part of their Stargate buildout, Nvidia and AMD for GPUs, AWS for cloud compute, and CoreWeave for data center usage rights.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, let's dive into some truly mind-boggling numbers coming out of OpenAI! According to a recent analysis, OpenAI is setting itself up for an unprecedented decade of growth, committing an astronomical $1.15 trillion to hardware and cloud infrastructure between 2025 and 2035. That's a 'T' for trillion, folks! This immense spending plan is strategically allocated across seven major technology powerhouses. We're talking about Broadcom leading the pack with an estimated $350 billion for custom AI accelerators, followed by Oracle at $300 billion for cloud infrastructure. Microsoft is looking at a substantial $250 billion for Azure cloud services, while Nvidia and AMD are set to receive $100 billion and $90 billion, respectively, for their cutting-edge GPUs. Amazon Web Services is also in the mix with a $38 billion commitment, and CoreWeave rounds it out with $22 billion for data center usage rights. The projections for annual compute spending are just as eye-popping, growing from $6 billion in 2025 to a staggering $173 billion by 2029, and then reaching an incredible $295 billion in 2030. To put this in perspective, OpenAI projects its gross profit margin to climb from 48% in 2025 to a robust 70% by 2029. But here's the kicker: to sustain these monumental infrastructure investments with those target margins, OpenAI's implied revenue would need to explode from around $10 billion in 2024 to an astonishing $577 billion by 2029! That's revenue on the scale of a tech titan like Google in the same timeframe. The article also delves into the nuances of accounting for these deals, distinguishing between hardware manufacturing costs, which are typically capitalized and depreciated, and cloud service expenses, which hit the cost of goods sold immediately. This colossal investment signals OpenAI's immense ambition and potential, solidifying its position at the forefront of the AI revolution. It's clear they're not just playing the long game; they're redefining it!
