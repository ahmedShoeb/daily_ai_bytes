## Key Points

- The paper introduces Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a new training paradigm for reinforcement learning
- ERL embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the RL process to handle sparse and delayed environmental feedback
- The method works by having the model generate an initial attempt, receive environmental feedback, produce a reflection, and then create a refined second attempt
- Success of the refined attempt is reinforced and internalized into the base policy, converting feedback into structured behavioral revision
- The approach improves exploration and stabilizes optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost
- ERL achieves up to 81% improvement in complex multi-step environments and up to 11% improvement in tool-using reasoning tasks
- The paper shows that explicit self-reflection integration into policy training transforms feedback into durable behavioral improvement
- This approach addresses the challenge of sparse and delayed feedback that's common in reinforcement learning applications
