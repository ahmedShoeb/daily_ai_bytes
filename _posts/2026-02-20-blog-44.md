## Key Points

- Figma announces new integration with Claude Code that allows developers to send work directly into Figma
- The 'Figma MCP' tool translates browser-rendered states into fully editable Figma layers when users type 'Send this to Figma'
- Figma emphasizes that design, craft, and point of view are key differentiators in an AI-powered world
- The article argues that the design canvas is better for navigating possibilities than prompting in an IDE or ADE
- Workflows are changing from linear processes (brainstorm → design → code) to more flexible approaches where you can 'start anywhere and go everywhere'
- The tool aims to help developers escape 'tunnel vision' and explore the big picture before committing to a design direction
- Figma wants to be the place where product building comes together, regardless of where it starts (terminal, prompt box, visual UI, or sketch)
- The author, Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field, discusses his background and the origins of Figma
