## Key Points

- Parallel's new FindAll API transforms natural language queries into custom, structured datasets from the web.
- The API identifies entities such as companies, people, or locations based on user-defined criteria and enriches them with structured data, complete with citations.
- FindAll Pro demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with 61% recall, which is 3x better than competing services.
- The FindAll process involves three stages: generating candidates from a proprietary web index, evaluating these candidates against specific match conditions, and then extracting structured enrichments using the Task API.
- All data points returned by FindAll include comprehensive verification through Parallel's Basis framework, offering citations, reasoning, excerpts, and confidence scores for verifiability.
- FindAll offers different models (Base, Core, Pro) with varying recall and cost-effectiveness, with FindAll Base being the most cost-effective option.
- Parallel Web Systems develops critical web search infrastructure for AI, and their APIs are used by Fortune 100 and 500 companies.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! Today, we're diving into some exciting news from Parallel, as they introduce their brand-new FindAll API. This isn't just another API; it's a powerful tool designed to turn your natural language queries into custom, structured datasets directly from the vast expanse of the web. Imagine being able to ask a question like, 'Find all dental practices in Ohio with 4+ star Google reviews,' and getting a meticulously organized dataset in return. That's exactly what FindAll promises.

The magic behind FindAll lies in its sophisticated three-stage pipeline. First, it generates potential candidates by searching across Parallel's own proprietary web index. Unlike traditional search, which gives you a fixed set of results, FindAll dynamically generates candidates tailored to your specific criteria. Next, each candidate is rigorously evaluated against your match conditions using multi-hop reasoning across various web sources. This ensures that only the entities that truly satisfy all your requirements make it to the final cut. Finally, for all matched entities, FindAll automatically orchestrates Parallel's Task API to extract any additional structured fields you've specified, from basic attributes like revenue to complex data points like strategic initiatives.

What truly sets FindAll apart is its commitment to data quality and verifiability. Every single data point returned by the API comes with comprehensive verification through their 'Basis framework.' This means you get citations linking back to the original source materials, detailed reasoning for why a match was made, relevant excerpts from web pages, and calibrated confidence scores. This level of granular attribution is incredibly valuable for workflows that require human oversight and a clear understanding of data provenance.

And let's talk performance! Parallel put FindAll to the test with a benchmark of 40 complex multi-criteria queries covering everything from public companies to specialized entities and people. The results are impressive: FindAll Pro achieves a state-of-the-art 61% recall, which is about three times higher than competitors like OpenAI Deep Research, Anthropic Deep Research, and Exa. Higher recall means FindAll is much better at finding all the correct matches for your queries. They also offer FindAll Base, which, while having a 30% recall, is the most cost-effective option on the market, making it accessible for a wider range of users. This API is available right now, and it looks like a game-changer for anyone looking to build high-quality, custom datasets from the web on demand. Parallel Web Systems, the company behind FindAll, is clearly making strides in developing critical web search infrastructure for AI, transforming tasks that once took days into minutes.
