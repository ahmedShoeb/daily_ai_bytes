## Key Points

AI models have advanced to perform real, economically valuable tasks, as demonstrated by an OpenAI test where they nearly matched human experts.
Next-generation AI is projected to outperform human experts in complex tasks, with current limitations being formatting and instruction adherence rather than errors.
AI primarily replaces specific tasks, not entire jobs, due to its specialized abilities and limitations in human-like interaction.
Autonomous AI agents are significantly improving, capable of multi-step tasks and tool usage without constant human intervention, driven by increased accuracy and self-correction.
AIs can now replicate complex academic research, offering a potential solution to the "replication crisis" by enabling large-scale validation of findings.
A key challenge is preventing the unproductive use of AI for excessive content generation; instead, a workflow of delegation, review, and correction is recommended.
Proper integration of AI could lead to 40% faster and 60% cheaper work, allowing humans to retain control and focus on judgment.
The impact of AI agents on the future of work hinges on human decisions regarding their application â€“ whether to enhance capabilities or merely cut costs.

## Key Topics Discussed

The article "Real AI agents and real work" explores the significant advancements in AI capabilities, indicating that artificial intelligence can now perform economically valuable tasks. A recent OpenAI test, involving experts from various industries, revealed that current AI models are nearly on par with human experts in completing complex, multi-hour tasks, with next-generation models expected to surpass human performance. Interestingly, AI's primary shortcomings were related to formatting and adherence to instructions, not factual errors or hallucinations.

The author emphasizes that while AI can replace specific tasks, it is not yet ready to replace entire jobs, as human roles typically involve a diverse set of tasks and complex human interactions that AI cannot fully replicate. However, some tasks AI can perform have immense value. A notable example provided is the AI's ability to replicate academic research. The author successfully used Claude Sonnet 4.5 to reproduce the findings of a sophisticated economics paper, including data analysis and statistical code conversion. This capability has profound implications for addressing the "replication crisis" in academia, enabling large-scale validation of published research which was previously a painstaking human effort.

The underlying reason for these advancements lies in the rapid improvement of AI agents. These agents can now plan, use tools like coding and web search, and accomplish multi-step tasks autonomously. This progress is attributed to increased accuracy in new models and their self-correcting abilities, allowing them to overcome errors and execute longer chains of actions.

The article also highlights the critical importance of how humans choose to deploy these AI agents. There's a risk of unimaginatively using AI for mere cost-cutting or, conversely, drowning in a flood of unneeded AI-generated content (e.g., excessive PowerPoint presentations). Instead, the OpenAI paper suggests a workflow where human experts delegate tasks to AI for an initial pass, then review, correct, and provide better instructions if necessary. This approach is estimated to make work 40% faster and 60% cheaper while ensuring human control. Ultimately, the article concludes that the transformative potential of AI agents depends on human judgment in deciding what work is truly valuable, rather than simply pursuing what is technically possible.
