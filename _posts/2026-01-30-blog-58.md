## Key Points

2025 will mark a shift from AI companies selling tools to selling abilities – enhancements that feel internal and instantly accessible.
Context-aware AI agents, integrated into body-worn devices like AI glasses, will be key to delivering these 'superpowers'.
These agents will provide real-time information, guidance, and perceptual coaching through whispered recommendations.
The technology will evolve from whispered commands to lip-reading and eventually to thought-based activation.
Meta and Google are leading the charge with Ray-Ban glasses, Orion prototypes, and Android XR, respectively.
A subscription-based business model is recommended to prioritize user benefit and avoid manipulative advertising.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, welcome to the show! Today we're diving into a fascinating article from VentureBeat about how AI is poised to give us all 'superpowers' in the very near future – specifically, starting in 2025. The core idea is a move away from simply providing *tools* that help us, to offering *abilities* that feel like natural extensions of ourselves. Think about learning a language – it starts as a tool, but eventually becomes a core ability. 

This is where context-aware AI agents come in. These agents will live inside devices we wear, like AI-powered glasses, constantly processing what we see and hear.  Imagine walking down the street and *thinking* 'What time does that store open?' and instantly getting the answer in your ear. That’s the power we’re talking about! The article outlines a really cool progression, starting with whispering commands, moving to mouthing words, and eventually, potentially controlling these agents with just our thoughts.  

By 2030, the author predicts most of us will be using these agents daily, receiving everything from subtle reminders to emotional assessments of the people around us. Big tech is already gearing up for this, with Meta and Google making significant investments in AR and AI. But the author also raises an important point: how do we ensure these powers aren’t used to manipulate us?  He suggests a subscription model, where companies focus on delivering valuable abilities rather than maximizing ad revenue. It's a really thought-provoking piece about the future of computing and how AI could fundamentally change our experience of the world – making us, in effect, superhuman. It’s definitely something to keep an eye on!
