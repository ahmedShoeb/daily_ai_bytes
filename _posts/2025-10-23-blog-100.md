## Key Points

- Anthropic is launching "Claude Code on the web," a new feature enabling developers to delegate coding tasks directly from their browser.
- This feature is currently in beta as a research preview for Pro and Max users.
- It allows for the assignment of multiple coding tasks to Claude, which run on Anthropic-managed cloud infrastructure.
- Coding sessions operate in isolated environments with real-time progress tracking, allowing users to steer Claude.
- The platform supports running multiple tasks in parallel across different repositories and includes automatic Pull Request creation.
- Claude Code on the web is effective for bugfixes, routine tasks, backend changes, and project inquiries.
- A mobile version of Claude Code is also available on the iOS app.
- Security is a priority, with tasks running in isolated sandbox environments and secure Git interactions via a proxy service.
- Users can customize network configurations for tasks.
- To get started, Pro and Max users can connect their repositories at claude.com/code.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey podcast listeners! Get ready for some exciting news from Anthropic! They've just unveiled "Claude Code on the web," a fantastic new feature that's going to change how developers tackle coding tasks. Imagine delegating your coding directly from your browserâ€”no more opening up your terminal for every little thing! Currently in a research preview for their Pro and Max users, Claude Code on the web lets you hand off multiple coding tasks to Claude. These tasks run securely on Anthropic's own cloud infrastructure, making it perfect for zapping bug backlogs, handling those routine fixes, or even diving into parallel development work. One of the coolest aspects is how you can kick off multiple coding sessions across different GitHub repositories all at once, from a single, streamlined interface. Each session gets its own isolated environment, complete with real-time progress tracking, and you can even actively guide Claude if you need to adjust its course. This means faster shipping times, especially with features like automatic Pull Request creation and super clear change summaries. Claude Code on the web is particularly brilliant for things like understanding how projects tick, squashing bugs, tackling well-defined routine tasks, and making backend changes where Claude can even use test-driven development to verify everything. And for those of you always on the go, they've even brought Claude Code to their iOS app, so you can explore mobile coding with Claude in its early preview stage. Security is a massive win here too; every Claude Code task runs in an isolated sandbox, with robust network and filesystem restrictions. Git interactions are handled through a secure proxy service, ensuring that Claude only touches authorized repositories and keeping your precious code and credentials super safe. Plus, you can even add custom network configurations, like allowing Claude to download npm packages for testing. If you're eager to dive deeper into the technical side, especially their sandboxing approach, Anthropic has an engineering blog and documentation ready for you. To jump in and start delegating your tasks, Pro and Max users can simply head over to claude.com/code and connect their first repository. Just a heads-up, those cloud-based sessions do share rate limits with all other Claude Code usage. This is a game-changer for developer productivity, and I can't wait to see what you all build with it!
