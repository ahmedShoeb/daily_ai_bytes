## Key Points

The article introduces 'slinky', a link shortener built by exe.dev that includes an unusual 'Edit with Shelley' button feature.
This feature allows users to directly edit and modify the software on the same VM through an AI agent called Shelley.
The author demonstrates how they used Shelley to add template parameters to URLs for Honeycomb queries, like replacing placeholders in trace IDs.
Shelley was able to implement this feature in just a few minutes, showcasing the system's efficiency.
The core concept is treating software like a wiki - if you don't like something, you can just click 'edit' and change it directly.
This represents a paradigm shift where software becomes more directly editable and customizable by users rather than requiring traditional development cycles.
