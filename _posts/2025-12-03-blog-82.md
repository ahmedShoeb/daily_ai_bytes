## Key Points

AI interfaces fundamentally revolve around understanding user 'intent' and leveraging 'context'.
'Intent' refers to the user's goal, which AI can uniquely grasp and respond to in a human-like manner.
Companies prioritize being closest to the origin of user intent, driving the development of AI-enabled devices like smart glasses.
'Context' is crucial for AI agents to effectively handle intent, encompassing diverse information from world knowledge to user-specific data and session history.
The concept of 'context engineering' involves building dynamic systems to deliver the right information and tools to the LLM for task accomplishment.
Big AI companies seek to embed AI where user context is rich, such as always-on cameras or email archives, to enhance effectiveness and gather training data.
'Context plumbing' describes the continuous process of moving dynamic, timely context from various sources to where AI agents need it to operate efficiently.
Unlike Web 2.0's CRUD apps, AI system architecture focuses on plumbing context flow that aligns with user expectations.
The author is currently implementing this 'context plumbing' architecture on Cloudflare for a new AI platform.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright folks, let's dive into some fascinating insights about how AI systems are being built, particularly what the author calls 'context plumbing.' This whole idea revolves around two core concepts for AI interfaces: 'intent' and 'context.' Intent is all about understanding what a user wants to achieve, whether it's a big goal or a small, implicit desire. AI's ability to grasp this intent and respond in a truly human way is a game-changer! Companies are really keen on being right there at the moment a user's intent arises, which is why we're seeing a push for all these AI-enabled devices like smart glasses and lanyards. It's all about minimizing the 'bureaucracy' between a user's desire and the result.

Now, for an AI to truly ace handling that intent, it needs a whole lot of 'context.' Think of it as all the relevant information an AI agent needs: world knowledge from its training data, documentation for the tools it uses, the user's past actions, the time of day, shared understandings, and even the specific document being worked on. This is where 'context engineering' comes in—building systems that dynamically feed the right information to the AI model so it can do its job effectively. This also explains why big AI companies want their tech embedded deeply in our lives, like in always-on cameras or our email archives. The more context an AI has, the more effective it becomes, and frankly, the more valuable training data they gather.

But here's the kicker: context isn't static; it's dynamic and constantly changing. User activities, environmental shifts—everything contributes to this evolving context. The challenge, then, is to continuously move this timely context from wherever it's created to where the AI agent needs it, without it getting stale or wasting resources. This is the 'plumbing' metaphor. It's a significant departure from the old 'CRUD' app architecture of Web 2.0. Instead, AI system architecture is about meticulously plumbing these flows of context, making sure they're not just technically sound but also intuitive for the user. The author shares that they're actively building such a platform on Cloudflare, where context flows seamlessly between various AI agents, making the whole system feel 'plumbed just right.' It sounds like a really exciting development in making AI systems truly effective!
