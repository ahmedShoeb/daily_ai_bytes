## Key Points

xAI's Grok Build is shaping up to be more ambitious than initially expected, evolving from a simple coding assistant toward a full-fledged IDE
The most notable new feature is Parallel Agents, allowing users to send a single prompt to multiple AI agents simultaneously with up to eight agents running at once (4 per model)
Parallel Agents interface exposes two models: Grok Code 1 Fast and Grok 4 Fast, with all agent responses visible side-by-side
The multi-agent approach aligns with Elon Musk's vision of Grok spawning 'hundreds of specialized coding agents all working together'
An arena mode is also being developed, which would have agents collaborate or compete to surface the best response, potentially scoring and ranking outputs automatically
Arena mode mirrors Google's Gemini Enterprise tournament-style framework where an Idea Generation agent ranks results through competition
The UI is getting a substantial overhaul with dictation support, new navigation tabs (Edits, Files, Plans, Search, Web Page) transforming it into a browser-based IDE
New collaboration features include Share button and Comments, along with GitHub app integration in settings (currently non-functional)
There's an internal 'Vibe' page for xAI staff serving as a model override tool
Grok 4.20 training has reportedly been delayed to mid-February due to infrastructure issues, making timeline for these features uncertain
