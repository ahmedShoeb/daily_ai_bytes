## Key Points

OpenRouter, an LLM API aggregator, allows users to manage multiple API keys with a single key.
OpenRouter previously charged a 5-5.5% fee on credits or upstream model charges.
Vercel launched an AI Gateway offering similar services with no markup, creating competition.
In response, OpenRouter has eliminated fees for the first 1 million requests on its 'bring your own key' plan.
This move is seen as Vercel commoditizing a complement and suggests a trend towards free open-source AI tooling.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, let's talk about some interesting developments in the AI tooling space! OpenRouter, a popular LLM API aggregator that helps you manage all your different AI model API keys with just one, has made a big change. Previously, they charged a fee of 5-5.5% on credits or on top of your upstream model charges. But now, they've dropped those fees for the first million requests on their 'bring your own key' plan. This move comes in direct response to Vercel's new AI Gateway product, which launched with a no-markup pricing model. Vercel's offering provides similar stats on popular models and apps, although it's not as detailed as OpenRouter's just yet. This competitive response from OpenRouter is a classic example of what's called 'commoditizing your complement,' and it could be a sign that AI tooling, much like other software, might be heading towards a future dominated by free and open-source solutions. It's an exciting time to watch how these strategies play out in the AI industry!
