## Key Points

New analysis by Apptopia indicates ChatGPT's mobile app download growth has slowed significantly since April.
Global daily active user (DAU) growth has also begun to stabilize, with October projected to see an 8.1% drop in global downloads month-over-month.
U.S. users are spending less time in the app, with average time spent per DAU down 22.5% and average sessions per DAU down 20.7% since July.
The decline in user engagement might be attributed to increased competition, particularly from Google's Gemini, and changes to ChatGPT's AI model making it less personable.
However, the downward trend in some metrics predates Gemini's surge.
Apptopia suggests the app is transitioning from an experimental tool to a routine part of users' daily lives.
To reverse the trend, OpenAI may need to invest in marketing or introduce new features.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, let's talk about some interesting trends in the AI app space! A new analysis from Apptopia suggests that ChatGPT's mobile app might be hitting a growth plateau. We're seeing estimates that new user growth, specifically global downloads, slowed down after April, and the global daily active user growth has really started to even out recently. In fact, October is looking like it might be down over 8% in terms of month-over-month global downloads.

Now, to be clear, we're talking about the *pace* of growth slowing, not a complete halt in downloads. Millions of new installs are still happening, but the rapid expansion we saw initially seems to be easing. Delving deeper, especially in the U.S., metrics like average time spent per user and average sessions per user have dropped significantly since July, suggesting users are engaging less frequently and for shorter periods. Interestingly, user churn has stabilized, which means the app is retaining its core audience, but perhaps fewer casual experimenters.

What could be causing this? Well, several factors are at play. Increased competition, notably from Google's Gemini, is a big one. Also, updates to ChatGPT's AI model, like those in April and August, aimed to make it less 'sycophantic' and potentially less personable, which might have impacted user engagement. However, Apptopia points out that some of these downward trends started even before Gemini's big surge, indicating it's not just competition. It's likely that the initial 'experimentation phase' with ChatGPT has passed, and for many, it's now just another tool in their daily routine. This means OpenAI will probably need to step up its game with marketing or introduce exciting new features to reignite that growth and boost those core metrics.
