## Key Points

In 2025, voice AIs are not significantly cheaper than human call center workers, especially when considering offshore options.
Factors like AI's ability to stay on-script, shorten call durations, or efficiently handle customer issues are crucial for economic improvement.
Potential risks of AI include failing to solve problems, requiring human intervention, providing incorrect advice, and hallucinations in sensitive contexts like medical records.
The voice AI industry comprises foundation model providers, AI orchestration platforms, and full-stack voice agent companies.
Analysis of platforms like Vapi and Bland shows that while some AI solutions are competitive with certain offshore labor markets, many developing countries still offer cheaper human alternatives.
A Canadian voice agent startup using Vapi would find it challenging to achieve profitability due to high API costs relative to minimum wage.
Future projections suggest that with an annual 30% decrease in GPU/inference costs, voice models could become cost-competitive with the world's cheapest human labor by approximately 2030.
Starting a voice agent company in 2025 may be viable with the right industry focus and sufficient venture capital, but ethical considerations regarding AI handling sensitive information are paramount.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! Let's talk about something fascinating today: the economics of swapping out our human call center workers for AIs. Now, you might think it's a no-brainer that AIs would be cheaper, right? Well, according to this article from LessWrong, in 2025, that's not quite the case. It turns out that voice AIs aren't significantly cheaper than their human counterparts, especially when you factor in global offshore options.The article dives into what really makes a difference economically. Can the AI stay perfectly on-script? Does it shorten call times, efficiently handle customer service issues, or even successfully deny claims or generate sales? These are the real questions that impact the bottom line. But it's not all sunshine and roses with AI. There are some serious risks to consider. What if the AI can't solve the customer's problem, leading to a frustrated customer who then demands a human? Or worse, what if it gives out wrong advice, opening up the company to legal liabilities? And in critical areas like medical records, the potential for AI hallucinations could have grave consequences, a thought that would make any jury squirm.The voice AI industry itself is pretty segmented, with companies that provide the foundational speech-to-text and text-to-speech models, others that orchestrate the AI interactions, and then the full-stack companies that handle everything. The article uses Vapi as a prime example, breaking down its technology stack and the associated API costs. When you compare these AI solutions to human call center salaries in various countries, it's an eye-opener. While some AI platforms, like Bland, might be competitive with labor costs in places like South Africa, many developing countries still offer significantly cheaper human labor.Imagine trying to launch a voice agent startup in Canada using Vapi. The article suggests you'd be battling brutal margins, with API costs alone almost matching the minimum wage of a human worker. So, profitability becomes a huge uphill climb. Of course, this analysis comes with a few assumptions and limitations, such as the assumed 100% utilization of human workers, the unknown impact of enterprise-level discounts, and the scope of platforms tested.But here's where it gets interesting for the future: the article projects that GPU and inference costs are dropping by about 30% each year. If that trend continues, we could see voice models becoming cost-competitive with even the cheapest human labor globally by around 2030. So, should you jump into starting a voice agent company in 2025? The advice is, 'Probably, if you find the right industry and raise enough VC money to stay alive for 5 years.' However, the article wisely leaves us with a bigger question for another time: should we really let AIs handle all customer service inquiries, sensitive personal information, and make critical tool calls to systems like Electronic Medical Records? Food for thought, folks!
