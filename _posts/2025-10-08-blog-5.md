## Key Points

The Jules API offers programmatic access to automate and enhance software development, integrate with tools like Slack, Linear, and GitHub.
Users authenticate via an API key found in the Jules web app settings, passed in the `X-Goog-Api-Key` header.
Core API concepts are Source (input like a GitHub repo), Session (a unit of work with a prompt and source), and Activity (a single work unit within a Session).
The quickstart guide covers listing sources, creating and managing sessions, approving plans, and interacting with the agent.

## Key Topics Discussed

The Jules API provides a programmatic interface to automate and augment software development processes. It enables users to create custom workflows, automate tasks such as bug fixing and code reviews, and embed Jules's intelligence directly into daily tools like Slack, Linear, and GitHub. To begin, users must generate an API key from the Jules web app settings, which is then used for authentication by including it in the `X-Goog-Api-Key` header of API requests. The API is structured around key concepts: a `Source`, which serves as an input for the agent (e.g., a GitHub repository); a `Session`, representing a continuous unit of work initiated with a prompt and a source; and an `Activity`, which is a single unit of work within a Session, encompassing actions like generating a plan or sending a message. A quickstart guide illustrates making API calls, starting with listing available sources, then creating a new session by specifying a prompt and source context. It also covers listing existing sessions, approving plans when required, and interacting with the agent by listing activities or sending messages.
