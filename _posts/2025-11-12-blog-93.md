## Key Points

- OpenAI sent a letter to the Trump administration proposing the expansion of the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) to include AI servers and data centers.
- The AMIC is currently a 35% tax credit from the Biden administration's Chips Act, focused on semiconductor fabrication.
- OpenAI believes expanding AMIC coverage would lower capital costs and accelerate AI infrastructure buildout in the US.
- The company also requested faster permitting processes and a strategic reserve of raw materials for AI infrastructure.
- OpenAI executives' recent comments, including CFO Sarah Friar's clarification on not seeking government backstops for loans, drew attention to the letter.
- CEO Sam Altman stated that OpenAI does not want government guarantees for its data centers and expects significant revenue growth and capital commitments in the coming years.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, welcome back to the podcast! Today, we're diving into some fascinating news about OpenAI and their strategic moves regarding federal support for their massive infrastructure plans. It turns out, OpenAI recently sent a letter to the Trump administration, specifically to the White House's director of science and technology policy, Michael Kratsios. In this letter, their chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, laid out a proposal to expand the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit, or AMIC. Now, the AMIC is currently a 35% tax credit under the Biden administration's Chips Act, primarily aimed at semiconductor fabrication. But OpenAI is pushing for it to cover a broader scope, including electrical grid components, AI servers, and crucially, AI data centers.

OpenAI's argument is that by broadening the AMIC's coverage, it would significantly lower the effective cost of capital, de-risk early investments, and unlock private capital, ultimately accelerating the build-out of AI infrastructure right here in the U.S. Beyond just tax credits, they also called for the government to speed up the permitting and environmental review processes for these huge projects. Plus, they suggested creating a strategic reserve of essential raw materials like copper, aluminum, and rare earth minerals, which are absolutely vital for constructing this next generation of AI infrastructure.

Interestingly, this letter didn't get a lot of buzz when it was first published, but it really hit the headlines this week after some comments from OpenAI executives. Our CFO, Sarah Friar, initially mentioned the idea of a government 'backstop' for OpenAI's infrastructure loans at a Wall Street Journal event. However, she quickly clarified on LinkedIn, saying she misspoke and that OpenAI isn't actually seeking a government backstop for their commitments. CEO Sam Altman also weighed in, making it clear that OpenAI doesn't 'have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.' He emphasized that governments shouldn't pick winners or losers and that taxpayers shouldn't have to bail out companies for bad business decisions. Altman did mention they've discussed loan guarantees in the context of supporting semiconductor fabs in the U.S. He also shared some incredible projections, expecting OpenAI to hit over $20 billion in annualized revenue by the end of 2025 and grow to hundreds of billions by 2030, with an astonishing $1.4 trillion in capital commitments planned over the next eight years! It's clear they have ambitious plans, and they're looking for government support to help pave the way.
