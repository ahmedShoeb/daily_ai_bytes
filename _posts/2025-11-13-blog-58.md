## Key Topics Discussed

Hey podcast listeners! Today, we're diving into the rapid ascent of Lovable, a Stockholm-based AI coding platform that's making some serious waves. CEO Anton Osika revealed that the company is fast approaching an impressive 8 million users, a huge leap from the 2.3 million they reported just a few months ago in July. And get this: they're seeing an incredible 100,000 new products being built on their platform every single day!

Founded barely a year ago, Lovable has already secured a whopping $228 million in funding, pushing its valuation to a substantial $1.8 billion. They even hit the $100 million mark in annual recurring revenue this past June. However, some questions have emerged regarding the sustainability of the "vibe coding" boom, with reports from Barclays suggesting a 40% drop in traffic to services like Lovable by September.

Despite these concerns, Osika remains confident, highlighting strong user retention with over 100% net dollar retention, meaning users are spending more over time. The company is also growing its team, bringing in leadership talent from San Francisco to their Stockholm headquarters. Lovable actually evolved from GPT Engineer, an open-source tool built by Osika, who quickly realized the potential to empower the 99% of people who don't know how to code. From Fortune 500 companies to an 11-year-old building a Facebook clone, the platform has attracted a truly diverse user base.

Security is a major focus for Lovable, especially given recent incidents in the vibe coding sector. Osika emphasized that they are rapidly expanding their security engineering team and have implemented multiple security checks before deployment, aiming to make building with Lovable even more secure than traditional human-written code. He also maintains a remarkably collegial view on competition from AI giants like OpenAI and Anthropic, believing there's ample room for multiple players to drive human creativity and agency.

Osika describes Lovable's mission as building "the last piece of software," a platform where product organizations can handle everything from understanding users to deploying critical features through a simple interface. He champions a "demo, don't memo" approach, enabling quick prototyping and testing of ideas. Interestingly, Osika, a former particle physicist, also shared his preference for a mission-driven European work culture over the intense hustle often seen in Silicon Valley, valuing team members who care deeply about their work without necessarily putting in excessive hours. It sounds like Lovable is not just building innovative tech, but also fostering a unique and thoughtful company culture.
