## Overview

Anthropic has expanded Claude Sonnet 4's context window to 1 million tokens, a five-fold increase that enables processing of entire codebases or dozens of research papers. This feature is currently in public beta on the Anthropic API and Amazon Bedrock, with future support planned for Google Cloud's Vertex AI. The extended context allows for more comprehensive and data-intensive AI applications, impacting fields like large-scale code analysis and document synthesis.

## Key Points

Claude Sonnet 4 now supports a 1 million token context window, a 5x increase.
This allows processing of large datasets like entire codebases (75,000+ lines) or multiple research papers.
It's available in public beta on Anthropic API and Amazon Bedrock, with Vertex AI support coming soon.
New use cases include large-scale code analysis, document synthesis, and context-aware agents.
Pricing adjusts for prompts over 200K tokens, with options for cost reduction via prompt caching and batch processing.

## Key Topics Discussed

Anthropic has announced a significant upgrade to its Claude Sonnet 4 model, expanding its context window to an impressive 1 million tokens. This represents a five-fold increase in the model's capacity, allowing it to process substantially larger amounts of information in a single request. For developers and researchers, this means the ability to handle entire codebases comprising over 75,000 lines of code, or to synthesize information from dozens of extensive research papers simultaneously. The long context support for Sonnet 4 is currently in public beta, accessible through the Anthropic API and Amazon Bedrock. Integration with Google Cloud's Vertex AI is also in the pipeline, indicating broader availability in the near future. This enhancement opens up new and more comprehensive use cases for Claude. For instance, in large-scale code analysis, developers can load an entire codebase, enabling Claude to understand project architecture, identify cross-file dependencies, and suggest system-wide improvements. Similarly, for document synthesis, the model can process vast sets of legal contracts, research papers, or technical specifications, analyzing relationships across hundreds of documents while maintaining complete context. Furthermore, it facilitates the creation of highly context-aware AI agents that can maintain coherence across numerous tool calls and complex, multi-step workflows by incorporating full API documentation and interaction histories. Anthropic has also outlined its API pricing structure for the extended context window. To accommodate the increased computational demands, pricing for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens will be adjusted. However, users can mitigate these costs and potentially reduce latency by utilizing prompt caching. Additionally, batch processing offers an extra 50% cost savings for the 1 million context window. Customer testimonials from companies like Bolt.new and iGent AI highlight the practical benefits of this expanded context. Bolt.new, a web development platform, finds Sonnet 4's 1M context window crucial for handling larger coding projects with high accuracy. iGent AI, which develops an AI partner for software engineering, notes that this leap has "supercharged autonomous capabilities" in their Maestro agent, enabling multi-day sessions on real-world codebases. This development positions Claude Sonnet 4 as a powerful tool for complex, data-intensive AI applications, offering enhanced capabilities for advanced research and enterprise-level solutions. Anthropic is also exploring ways to bring this long context feature to other Claude products.
