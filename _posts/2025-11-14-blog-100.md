## Key Topics Discussed

Alright everyone, get ready because AMD has just given us a peek into their exciting future with an updated Zen CPU roadmap! They shared these plans at their Financial Analyst Day, really hyping up what's coming next for Ryzen and EPYC processors. A huge takeaway is the official confirmation of Zen 6, which is on track for a 2026 release. This generation is going to be built using TSMC's advanced 2nm (N2) process nodes, which is a massive leap! We can expect some sweet improvements in Instructions Per Cycle, or IPC, and even more integrated AI features across both their desktop Ryzen and server EPYC lineups. They even dropped some names for future Zen 6-based products, including EPYC "Venice," Ryzen Desktop "Olympic Ridge," and Ryzen Mobile "Medusa Point." But wait, there's more! Looking a bit further down the road, AMD officially teased Zen 7, which they're calling the "true next-generation" product. This suggests some serious architectural shake-ups are coming! Zen 7 is anticipated to arrive around 2027-2028 and will be built on what they're calling a "Future Node." It's also set to introduce a "New Matrix Engine" to supercharge AI capabilities even further. The first products we might see with Zen 7 are the EPYC "Verano" data center CPUs. It's clear from this presentation that AMD is doubling down on its AI ambitions, which truly shows where the industry is heading!
