## Overview

Infrastructure choices significantly impact distributed LLM training performance. Benchmarks show that InfiniBand networking provides 10x faster training than Ethernet, and optimal storage can speed up checkpointing by almost 2x. Combined, these optimizations can deliver 6-7x end-to-end speedup.

## Key Points

- Infrastructure choices are critical for distributed LLM training.
- InfiniBand networking offers 10x faster training than Ethernet.
- Optimizing storage can speed up checkpointing by almost 2x.
- Combined, these optimizations yield a 6-7x end-to-end speedup.
- The article provides detailed benchmarks and configurations for different network and storage types.

## Key Topics Discussed

The article 'Network and Storage Benchmarks for LLM Training on the Cloud' underscores the often-overlooked yet critical role of infrastructure configuration in distributed Large Language Model (LLM) training. It presents compelling benchmark results demonstrating that network and storage choices can lead to dramatic performance differences. Specifically, InfiniBand networking is shown to provide a remarkable tenfold increase in training speed compared to standard Ethernet. Furthermore, optimizing storage configurations can nearly double the speed of crucial operations like checkpointing. When these network and storage optimizations are combined, the article reports an impressive 6-7x end-to-end speedup in LLM training. The author details experiments conducted with Gemma 3 12B and GPT-OSS-120B models on Nebius, analyzing how data flows through the training pipeline and where bottlenecks typically emerge. The post provides practical advice on configuring various storage types (Local NVMe, Nebius Shared Filesystem, Object Store) and leveraging tools like SkyPilot to abstract away complexity while enabling high-performance settings. The findings emphasize that maximizing GPU utilization is not solely about powerful accelerators but equally about ensuring a robust and efficient data supply chain through optimized network and storage solutions.
