## Key Points

- The article discusses how AI-generated content often contains subtle errors that only domain experts can spot, using an example of a photorealistic tennis clip where an experienced player noticed an impossible backhand motion
- There's a structural limitation to AI's ability to create perfect content: it converges to the average, systematically avoiding outliers where true quality resides
- Three compounding factors contribute to this limitation: 1) mathematical nature of next-token prediction favoring probable outputs, 2) RLHF reinforcing typicality, and 3) model collapse from training on AI-generated content
- Humanity's Last Exam data shows AI models score only 37.5% while human domain experts average 90%, revealing a massive 53-point gap in genuine understanding
- Research consistently shows human-AI collaboration (centaur model) outperforms either alone, with humans providing crucial judgment to catch AI errors
- Studies show AI-exposed consultants perform 19 percentage points worse on tasks outside AI's capabilities when they blindly trust AI output
- AI hallucination rates in specialized fields like law range from 69% to 88%, and these errors can go undetected without expert oversight
- The author argues domain expertise is appreciating in value, not depreciating, because it's what enables people to identify when AI is wrong
- There's a risk of deskilling where professionals may fail to develop independent judgment by over-relying on AI early in their careers
- The article concludes that AI makes good practitioners better and bad practitioners worse, emphasizing partnership over replacement
