## Key Points

- OpenAI announced multiyear partnerships with four major consulting firms: Accenture, Boston Consulting Group, Capgemini, and McKinsey & Co.
- These 'Frontier Alliances' are designed to help deploy OpenAI's enterprise platform called Frontier across various organizations.
- The partnerships aim to accelerate AI deployment for enterprise clients and help companies realize the value of AI more quickly.
- OpenAI is competing aggressively against rivals like Google and Anthropic for enterprise market share, with enterprises currently accounting for about 40% of OpenAI's business.
- Frontier acts as an intelligence layer that integrates disparate systems and data within organizations to manage, deploy, and build AI agents.
- The consulting firms will help customers define AI strategy and implement agents into production workflows more efficiently.
- OpenAI partnered with consulting firms because they have existing enterprise relationships and deep business knowledge that OpenAI lacks.
- Consulting firms are building dedicated teams and practice groups certified on OpenAI technology with access to technical resources and product roadmaps.
