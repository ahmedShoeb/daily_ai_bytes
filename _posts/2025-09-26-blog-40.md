## Key Points

- Americans are much more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life, with a majority saying they want more control over how AI is used in their lives.
- Far larger shares say AI will erode than improve people’s ability to think creatively and form meaningful relationships.
- At the same time, a majority is open to letting AI assist them with day-to-day tasks and activities.
- Most Americans don’t support AI playing a role in personal matters such as religion or matchmaking. They’re more open to AI for heavy data analysis, such as for weather forecasting and developing new medicines.
- Americans feel strongly that it’s important to be able to tell if pictures, videos or text were made by AI or by humans. Yet many don’t trust their own ability to spot AI-generated content.

## Key Topics Discussed

The Pew Research Center survey reveals that Americans are generally more concerned than excited about the growing presence of artificial intelligence in daily life, with a strong desire for greater control over its usage. A significant majority believes AI will negatively impact human abilities such as creative thinking and the formation of meaningful relationships, with 53% stating it will worsen creative thinking and 50% believing it will deteriorate relationships. Despite these concerns, a majority of Americans are open to utilizing AI for assistance with everyday tasks.

The survey highlights a clear distinction in public acceptance of AI roles. While there is strong opposition to AI involvement in personal matters like religion or matchmaking, Americans are more receptive to AI performing data-intensive analytical tasks in fields such as weather forecasting, financial crime detection, and medical development. The importance of distinguishing between AI-generated and human-created content is also a major concern, with 76% deeming it crucial, yet 53% lacking confidence in their ability to make such a distinction.

Awareness of AI is nearly universal among U.S. adults, with 95% having heard about it. However, the survey shows a rising level of wariness, with 50% expressing more concern than excitement about AI's increased use, a notable increase from 37% in 2021. A majority (57%) perceive the societal risks of AI as high, often citing the potential weakening of human skills and connections as a primary concern. Younger adults, specifically those under 30, demonstrate higher awareness and interaction with AI but also share similar concerns about its negative impact on creative thinking and relationships.
