## Key Points

- Amazon Nova Forge is a new service for building custom frontier models using Amazon Nova.
- It allows organizations to start model development from early checkpoints (pre-training, mid-training, post-training).
- Customers can blend proprietary datasets with Amazon Nova-curated training data to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve foundational skills.
- Nova Forge supports reinforcement learning with custom reward functions and orchestrators for complex multi-turn scenarios.
- A built-in responsible AI toolkit is included for configuring safety and content moderation settings.
- Custom Nova models built with Nova Forge can be imported as private models on Amazon Bedrock, ensuring security and integration.
- The service is designed for organizations with proprietary or industry-specific data, addressing limitations of current customization approaches.
- Use cases span manufacturing, research and development, content and media, and other specialized industries.
- It provides a cost-effective way to build highly specialized AI models with deep domain understanding.
- Amazon Nova Forge is currently available in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright podcast listeners, get ready for some exciting news from AWS! They're introducing something called Amazon Nova Forge, and it's a huge step forward for anyone wanting to build truly specialized AI models. If you've been working with generative AI and realized that standard models, even with prompt engineering or RAG, just don't quite grasp your deep domain expertise or unique business context, then this is for you.

Nova Forge is designed to help organizations create their own 'frontier models' using Amazon Nova. The challenge with existing methods is that they often don't allow you to embed specialized knowledge deeply enough, or they come too late in the development cycle. And let's be honest, training a model from scratch is a massive undertaking in terms of data, compute, and cost for most organizations.

This new service tackles those issues head-on. You can start your model development from early checkpoints – like pre-training, mid-training, or post-training phases – which is super flexible. A really cool feature is the ability to blend your own proprietary data with Amazon's Nova-curated training data. This isn't just a minor detail; it's crucial for preventing something called 'catastrophic forgetting,' where models lose their core intelligence while learning new, specialized content. This blending helps them keep their foundational skills, general instruction following, and safety benefits intact while integrating your unique knowledge.

For those of you into more advanced AI, Nova Forge also offers robust support for reinforcement learning. You can use your own reward functions and orchestrators for managing complex, multi-turn AI agent workflows. So, if you're simulating robotics or optimizing molecular designs, you can connect your specific environments directly. Plus, they've included a responsible AI toolkit, letting you configure safety and content moderation settings to perfectly match your business's needs.

Integration is seamless too. You'll use familiar Amazon SageMaker AI tools for your training, and then you can easily import your custom Nova models as private models on Amazon Bedrock. This means you get all the same security, consistent APIs, and broad AWS integrations that come with any Bedrock model. It’s currently available in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region, providing access to multiple Nova model checkpoints and proven training recipes. So, if you're looking to build AI that truly understands your world, Amazon Nova Forge could be the powerful new tool you've been waiting for!
