## Overview

Anthropic's Safeguards team implements a multi-layered approach to ensure Claude's beneficial use while preventing misuse. This involves developing usage policies, influencing model training, rigorous pre-deployment testing for harmful outputs and biases, real-time detection and enforcement, and ongoing monitoring for sophisticated attack patterns. Their comprehensive strategy aims to keep Claude helpful and safe throughout its lifecycle.

## Key Points

Anthropic's Safeguards team focuses on preventing misuse and ensuring beneficial outcomes for Claude users.
Their approach spans policy development (Usage Policy, Unified Harm Framework, Policy Vulnerability Testing), influencing model training, and testing.
Pre-deployment evaluations include safety assessments, risk assessments (e.g., CBRNE), and bias evaluations.
Real-time detection and enforcement use AI-powered classifiers to steer responses or take account actions.
Ongoing monitoring and investigation identify sophisticated attack patterns and inform threat intelligence.

## Key Topics Discussed

Anthropic is committed to ensuring that Claude, its large language model, empowers users while being channeled towards beneficial outcomes and preventing misuse that could lead to real-world harm. This commitment is spearheaded by their dedicated Safeguards team, which comprises experts in policy, enforcement, product, data science, threat intelligence, and engineering. This diverse team works collaboratively to identify potential misuses, respond to emerging threats, and build robust defenses to maintain Claude's helpfulness and safety. Their strategy operates across multiple layers, encompassing the entire lifecycle of the models. The first layer involves **Policy Development**, where the Safeguards team designs the Usage Policyâ€”a framework defining appropriate and inappropriate uses of Claude. This policy addresses critical areas such as child safety, election integrity, and cybersecurity, and provides nuanced guidance for industry-specific applications like healthcare and finance. The policy development is guided by a Unified Harm Framework, which helps the team understand potential harmful impacts across physical, psychological, economic, societal, and individual autonomy dimensions. They also engage in Policy Vulnerability Testing, partnering with external domain experts in areas like terrorism and mental health to stress-test policies and model outputs against challenging prompts. Findings from these tests directly inform policy adjustments and system improvements, such as adding banners to direct users to authoritative sources during elections. The second layer focuses on **Claude's Training**. The Safeguards team collaborates closely with fine-tuning teams to prevent harmful behaviors and responses. This includes extensive discussions on desired and undesired model behaviors, which inform the traits built into Claude during training. Evaluation and detection processes also flag potentially harmful outputs, leading to updates in reward models or adjustments to system prompts. Anthropic also partners with specialists like ThroughLine for online crisis support to refine Claude's understanding of sensitive areas, ensuring nuanced and caring responses to topics like self-harm and mental health, rather than complete refusal or misinterpretation of user intent. Through this, Claude learns to decline assistance with illegal activities, recognize attempts to generate malicious code, and discuss sensitive topics carefully. Before new models are released, **Testing and Evaluation** form a crucial layer. This includes rigorous safety evaluations for adherence to the Usage Policy, assessing scenarios from clear violations to ambiguous contexts and multi-turn conversations. Risk assessments are conducted for high-risk domains like cyber harm or CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons and high-yield explosives), often in partnership with government entities. Bias evaluations are also performed to ensure consistent, reliable, and accurate responses across different contexts and users, checking for political bias or biases related to identity attributes. These pre-deployment tests verify that training holds up under pressure and identify needs for additional guardrails. The results are transparently reported in system cards released with each new model family. Once models are deployed, **Real-time Detection and Enforcement** come into play, utilizing automated systems and human review. AI-powered "classifiers" are specifically fine-tuned Claude models designed to detect policy violations in real-time, monitoring for specific harms while the conversation flows naturally. This includes specific detection for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Enforcement actions can range from response steering, where Claude's interpretation of prompts is adjusted to prevent harmful output, to account-level actions like warnings or termination for repeated violations. These systems are complex, requiring advanced machine learning research and engineering solutions to process trillions of tokens efficiently while minimizing false positives. Finally, **Ongoing Monitoring and Investigation** go beyond individual prompts to understand the prevalence of harms and identify sophisticated attack patterns. This involves using insights tools to measure real-world Claude usage in a privacy-preserving manner, analyzing conversation clusters, and using hierarchical summarization for computer use capabilities to spot behaviors that are only violative in aggregate, such as automated influence operations. Threat intelligence is also gathered by studying severe misuses, identifying adversarial patterns, cross-referencing external threat data, and monitoring channels where bad actors operate. Anthropic actively seeks feedback and partnerships from users, researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations, and maintains a bug bounty program to continuously improve its defenses. The company also actively recruits talent for its Safeguards team, underscoring the ongoing commitment to responsible AI development.
