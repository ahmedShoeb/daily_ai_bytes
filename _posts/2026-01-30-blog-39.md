## Key Points

- Nvidia unveiled Project DIGITS, a $3,000 desktop computer built for AI research and experimentation at home.
- The machine is powered by Nvidia’s new GB10 Grace‑Blackwell Superchip, which pairs a Blackwell GPU with a 20‑core Arm‑based Grace CPU.
- It ships with up to 128 GB of RAM and up to 4 TB of internal storage.
- A single DIGITS unit can run AI models up to 200 billion parameters; two linked units can handle models up to 405 billion parameters.
- Designed as a “cloud‑computing platform on your desk,” it lets developers prototype locally before moving workloads to the cloud.
- Target audience includes researchers, data scientists, students, and hobbyists who want to experiment with chatbots, image generators, and other generative AI models.
- The product debuted at CES 2025 and is slated for a May 2025 launch, with options to operate as a standalone PC or as an accelerator attached to a Windows or Mac host.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey folks, big news from Nvidia that’s going to shake up the AI hobbyist scene. At CES 2025 the company rolled out Project DIGITS, a compact desktop priced at about $3,000 that’s purpose‑built for running large language and generative models right on your desk. The heart of the system is Nvidia’s brand‑new GB10 Grace‑Blackwell Superchip – a hybrid of a Blackwell GPU and a 20‑core Grace CPU based on Arm architecture, co‑designed with MediaTek. Inside the chassis you’ll find up to 128 GB of memory and up to 4 TB of storage, giving you the headroom to load hefty models.

What makes DIGITS exciting is its ability to run models that were previously locked to massive data‑center GPUs. Nvidia claims a single unit can handle AI models with up to 200 billion parameters, and if you link two units together you can push that to roughly 405 billion parameters. In practical terms, that means you could experiment with fairly sophisticated chatbots, image generators, or other generative AI tools without needing a cloud subscription.

The device is marketed as a bridge between desktop development and cloud deployment. You can prototype locally, test performance, and then migrate the same workloads to Nvidia‑powered cloud services or on‑premise clusters. It’s aimed at researchers, data scientists, students, and even hobbyists who want a sandbox for AI without the overhead of remote servers.

Project DIGITS can run as a standalone PC or act as an accelerator attached to an existing Windows or macOS machine, giving you flexibility in how you integrate it into your workflow. Nvidia says the product will ship in May 2025, and the price point is deliberately set to be accessible for labs and individuals alike. If you’ve been waiting for a way to bring cutting‑edge AI models into your own garage or office, this could be the first real option that balances power, price, and convenience.

Overall, Nvidia is positioning DIGITS as a “cloud‑computing platform on your desk,” a statement that underscores the company’s push to democratize AI compute. It’s a bold step toward making large‑scale AI experimentation a desktop reality, and it could spark a new wave of local AI development that blurs the line between personal hardware and enterprise‑grade performance.
