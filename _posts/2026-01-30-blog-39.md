## Key Points

- The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is piloting an AI program to detect bid-rigging in public procurement contracts.
- The AI scans large amounts of bidding data to identify anomalies and potential anti-competitive behavior.
- CMA chief Sarah Cardell highlighted the significant risk of bid-rigging in procurement markets.
- This comes after the CMA launched an inquiry into school roofing contract bid-rigging.
- Last year, the CMA fined 10 construction firms £60 million ($75 million) for similar collusion.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, so the U.K.'s competition authority, the CMA, is getting pretty clever in how they're tackling anti-competitive practices. They're now using AI to sniff out 'bid-rigging,' which is basically when companies secretly work together to inflate costs on public contracts. The CMA is running a pilot program where AI scans through tons of bidding data, looking for anything that seems off – like patterns that suggest companies weren't actually competing fairly. Sarah Cardell, the head of the CMA, said that procurement markets are particularly vulnerable to this kind of thing. This is happening right after they started looking into potential bid-rigging for school roofing contracts, and it follows a big £60 million fine they handed out last year to 10 construction companies for doing the same thing. So, they’re really taking this seriously and hoping AI will help them catch these schemes faster and more effectively. It's a really interesting use of AI to protect public funds and ensure fair competition!
