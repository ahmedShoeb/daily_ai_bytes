## Key Points

Anthropic is experimenting with a new feature called "Imagine" within Claude, designed to generate user interfaces dynamically.
Imagine presents a classic desktop-like environment with familiar UI elements, allowing users to build apps and digital artifacts.
The UI itself is rendered by an agent, guided by a system prompt, signifying a deeper architectural shift towards generative interfaces where AI actively manipulates the DOM.
The internal codename for this agent is Heli, and it suggests a layered system where one agent builds the UI while others handle underlying logic.
Currently, "Imagine" is a demo with limited availability, indicating an experimental phase rather than a public release.
This development suggests Claude could evolve from a chat assistant into a platform capable of spawning and managing dynamic, AI-generated workspaces.

## Key Topics Discussed

Anthropic is currently experimenting with an innovative feature named "Imagine" within its Claude AI. This feature manifests as a desktop-style environment directly within the Claude interface, presenting familiar UI elements like icons, a trash can, and a "What do you want to build?" prompt. Designed to function as a lightweight agent, Imagine enables users to generate various applications and digital artifacts directly. The desktop metaphor aims to ease new generative AI users into the system by leveraging their familiarity with traditional operating systems.

A significant aspect of Imagine is its underlying architecture: the UI itself is rendered by an agent, guided by a sophisticated system prompt. This indicates that an AI agent is actively manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to construct the interface from predefined components, rather than merely producing text or code. The internal codename for this agent is Heli, and the system prompt restricts Claude from writing scripts, suggesting a layered system where one agent generates the UI while others manage logic.

Anthropic emphasizes that Imagine is currently a demo, potentially available for a limited time or to specific users, possibly those on Max plans. There is no firm release date or detailed guidance on its future availability. This experiment points towards a substantial shift in how users interact with software, moving from static websites and pre-designed applications to dynamic, AI-generated workspaces where interfaces are assembled on demand by the model, integrating other agents as needed. This positions Claude to evolve from a conversational assistant into a platform for creating and managing generative interfaces.
