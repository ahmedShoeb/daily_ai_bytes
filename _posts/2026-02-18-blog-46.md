## Key Points

OpenAI has recruited a prominent developer (Steipete) to work on bringing AI agents to everyone, focusing on creating agents that even non-technical users can use
OpenClaw, the developer's popular AI project, will move to a foundation structure to remain open source and independent
The developer turned down opportunities to build a startup company around OpenClaw, stating they want to change the world rather than build a large company
OpenAI has made strong commitments to support OpenClaw development and already sponsors the project
The decision came after discussions with major AI labs and access to unreleased research during a week in San Francisco
The developer emphasized safety as a key consideration for building accessible AI agents
OpenClaw's community is described as 'magical' and will continue as a place for thinkers, hackers, and privacy-conscious users who want to own their data
The move positions the developer to be part of frontier AI research at OpenAI while maintaining OpenClaw's open source mission
