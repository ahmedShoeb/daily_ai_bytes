## Key Points

Mistral AI, the French company valued at $13.8 billion, has made its first acquisition by buying Koyeb, a Paris-based startup that simplifies AI app deployment
Koyeb helps developers deploy AI applications without worrying about server infrastructure using a serverless approach, and recently launched Koyeb Sandboxes for isolated AI agent environments
The acquisition confirms Mistral's ambitions to become a full-stack AI player beyond just developing large language models
Koyeb's 13 employees and three co-founders will join Mistral's engineering team, with Koyeb's technology becoming a core component of Mistral Compute
Mistral recently announced a $1.4 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has passed $400 million in annual recurring revenue
Koyeb had raised $8.6 million to date, with its latest $7 million seed round led by Paris-based VC firm Serena
Koyeb's platform will continue operating but will now focus on helping Mistral deploy models on clients' own hardware, optimize GPU usage, and scale AI inference
The deal is seen as building sovereign AI infrastructure in Europe, with Mistral positioning itself as a European alternative to U.S. infrastructure
New users will no longer be able to sign up for Koyeb's Starter tier as the company shifts focus to enterprise clients
Mistral didn't disclose financial terms of the deal but is actively hiring for infrastructure roles while pitching itself as a European frontier research organization
