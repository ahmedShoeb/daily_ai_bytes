## Key Topics Discussed

Alright podcast listeners, we've got some interesting insights for you today! Theory Ventures has just dropped the results of their "AI in Practice" survey, and it's a deep dive into how AI is *really* being used out there in the wild. This wasn't just a casual look; they went straight to 413 senior technical builders—the folks actually shipping AI into real systems—to get the lowdown. They surveyed across different company sizes, industries, and locations to get a comprehensive picture. The big idea here was to cut through the hype and figure out what AI tools and components are truly being adopted in production environments, not just what's being demoed or pitched by vendors. And for all you founders listening, this is gold! The results are available as an interactive dataset, designed to be a diagnostic tool. You can use it to pressure-test your go-to-market strategies, refine your ideal customer profiles, and even spot market segments that are either overflowing with solutions, totally underserved, or completely untapped. It's all about providing actionable insights for those building in the fast-paced AI infrastructure space. They've shared their core findings, and they're inviting everyone to dig into the data and find answers to their own specific questions about AI adoption and scaling.
