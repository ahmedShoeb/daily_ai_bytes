## Key Topics Discussed

Coco Robotics, a startup specializing in last-mile delivery bots, is embarking on a significant initiative to advance its autonomous capabilities by establishing a new physical AI research lab. The company has brought on University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Professor Bolei Zhou to lead this endeavor, also appointing him as their Chief AI Scientist. This strategic move aims to leverage the vast amount of data — "millions of miles" collected over five years in complex urban settings — that Coco Robotics' robots have amassed. The goal is to delve deeper into automation, ultimately enabling their delivery bots to operate more autonomously and reduce overall delivery costs.

Coco Robotics co-founder and CEO Zach Rash highlighted the importance of this data for training reliable real-world AI systems and expressed confidence that Professor Zhou, a leading researcher in robot navigation, reinforcement learning, and computer vision, is the ideal choice to spearhead this research. The company already had a collaborative relationship with Zhou, and both co-founders are UCLA alums. This new research lab operates independently from Coco Robotics' existing partnership with OpenAI. The insights and advancements generated by the lab will primarily be utilized internally to enhance the company's automation and efficiency, particularly for the local models powering their robots. Additionally, Coco Robotics intends to share applicable research findings with the cities they operate in, aiming to address infrastructure challenges that impact their delivery bots. The overarching vision for this lab is to deliver a higher-quality service at an exceptionally low price, which Coco Robotics believes will stimulate considerable growth within the last-mile delivery ecosystem.
