## Key Points

Perplexity is developing new features for its email assistant, including a "Meeting Preferences" section.
Upcoming features are expected to allow automatic recording of meetings, the assistant joining meetings autonomously, and specified recipients receiving recaps.
These features aim to streamline meeting documentation and follow-up for professionals and teams.
The meeting recap function draws parallels to Google Meet's Gemini-powered notes and summary tool.
Perplexity's additions fit its strategy to offer more proactive, integrated workflow tools.
The company has not made an official statement about these features, so their availability and scope remain speculative.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, it looks like Perplexity is really stepping up its game with some exciting new features for its assistant! We're hearing that they're developing meeting automation tools, with a hidden 'Meeting Preferences' section already spotted in recent builds. Imagine this: your Perplexity Assistant could soon automatically record your meetings, join them on its own, and even send out recaps to the right people. This is huge for streamlining how we document and follow up after meetings, cutting down on all that manual note-taking. It sounds a lot like Google Meet's Gemini-powered notes, so Perplexity is definitely aiming to compete with the big players in workplace assistants. While the current focus seems to be on recording and distributing information, there's a lot of potential for this to evolve into project management and scheduling. These updates are totally in line with Perplexity's goal to offer more proactive, integrated tools, and really solidify its place in our daily business operations, especially for those of us already using their research and summarization features. Just a heads up though, the company hasn't officially announced these features yet, so the exact timing and full scope are still a bit speculative. But it's definitely something to keep an eye on as the AI-driven productivity landscape continues to evolve!
