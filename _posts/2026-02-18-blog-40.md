## Key Points

- The paper proposes a framework for intelligent AI delegation where AI agents can decompose complex tasks and delegate them to other AI agents or humans
- Current delegation methods rely on simple heuristics and cannot adapt to environmental changes or handle failures robustly
- The framework involves decisions about task allocation, transfer of authority, responsibility, and accountability
- It incorporates clear specifications for roles, boundaries, intent, and trust mechanisms between parties
- The framework is designed to work with both human and AI delegators/delegatees in complex delegation networks
- It aims to inform development of protocols for the emerging 'agentic web'
- The research addresses the need for AI agents to achieve more ambitious goals through meaningful problem decomposition
