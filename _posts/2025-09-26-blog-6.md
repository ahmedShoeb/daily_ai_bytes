## Key Points

Americans are much more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life, with a majority saying they want more control over how AI is used in their lives.
Far larger shares say AI will erode than improve people’s ability to think creatively and form meaningful relationships.
A majority is open to letting AI assist them with day-to-day tasks and activities.
Most Americans don’t support AI playing a role in personal matters such as religion or matchmaking but are more open to AI for heavy data analysis, such as for weather forecasting and developing new medicines.
Americans feel strongly that it’s important to be able to tell if pictures, videos or text were made by AI or by humans, yet many don’t trust their own ability to spot AI-generated content.

## Key Topics Discussed

The Pew Research Center conducted a survey from June 9 to 15, 2025, among 5,023 U.S. adults, revealing how Americans perceive artificial intelligence and its societal implications. A primary finding indicates that Americans are more concerned than excited about AI's increasing presence in daily life, with 50% expressing concern compared to 10% feeling excited, and 38% feeling equally both. This concern has increased from 37% in 2021. The survey highlights a widespread pessimism regarding AI's potential impact on human creativity and the ability to form meaningful relationships; specifically, 53% believe AI will diminish creative thinking, and 50% foresee a negative effect on relationship formation. While some optimism exists concerning AI's role in improving problem-solving skills (29% positive, 38% negative), a notable portion of respondents remain uncertain about these effects. A significant majority of Americans (57%) categorize the societal risks of AI as high, a much larger proportion than those who view AI's benefits as high (25%). Common concerns include AI's potential to weaken human skills and connections. Approximately six-in-ten Americans express a desire for greater control over AI's application in their lives, and 76% deem it critically important to distinguish between AI-generated and human-created content. However, 53% of Americans lack confidence in their ability to identify AI-produced content. Regarding AI's integration into society, Americans largely resist its involvement in personal aspects such as matchmaking or religious guidance. For instance, about two-thirds oppose AI determining romantic compatibility, and 73% believe AI should not offer faith-based advice. Conversely, there is higher acceptance for AI in data-intensive analytical tasks across scientific, financial, and medical fields. This includes areas like weather forecasting (74%), identifying financial crimes (70%), detecting government benefit fraud (70%), developing new medicines (66%), and identifying crime suspects (61%). Less than half (46%) support AI for mental health support. The survey also uncovers a substantial generational divide, with younger adults demonstrating greater AI awareness and interaction compared to those aged 65 and older, and also being more inclined to believe AI will negatively impact creative thinking and relationship building.
