## Key Points

Intel is announcing a new inference-optimized enterprise GPU, codenamed "Crescent Island".
Crescent Island is built on the next-gen Xe3P Celestial micro-architecture.
It will feature 160GB of LPDDR5x memory, optimized for large language models (LLMs).
The graphics card is designed for performance-per-Watt, air-cooled, and cost-optimized.
It supports various data types and is ideal for tokens-as-a-service providers and inference use cases.
Customer sampling for Crescent Island will begin in the second half of 2026.
Crescent Island is expected to compete with AMD Instinct MI450 series and NVIDIA Vera Rubin.
Intel is also announcing new Gaudi 3 rack-scale reference designs, supporting up to 64 accelerators per rack with liquid cooling and 8.2TB of high bandwidth memory.
The Gaudi 3 software support has been neglected, with no mainline kernel driver support for Linux 6.18.
Intel is refining its open-source software stack for Crescent Island using current-generation Arc Pro B-Series GPUs.

Customer sampling for this data center GPU is slated to begin in the second half of 2026, with a broader release likely in 2027. Intel anticipates Crescent Island will compete with upcoming offerings like the AMD Instinct MI450 series and NVIDIA Vera Rubin. The company is also working on refining its open-source software stack for Crescent Island by utilizing current-generation Arc Pro B-Series GPUs. In addition to the Crescent Island announcement, Intel is also showcasing new Gaudi 3 rack-scale reference designs at the OCP Global Summit. These designs will support up to 64 accelerators per rack with liquid cooling and 8.2TB of high-bandwidth memory. However, the article notes that Gaudi 3's software support has been neglected, with a lack of mainline kernel driver support even for Linux 6.18.
