## Key Points

Arm-based CPUs will now integrate with Nvidia's NVLink Fusion technology for AI chips.
This collaboration simplifies pairing Arm-based Neoverse CPUs with Nvidia GPUs, especially for hyperscalers and custom infrastructure users.
Nvidia is opening its NVLink platform to integrate with a wider variety of custom chips, signaling a shift from proprietary CPU requirements.
Major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are already developing and deploying Arm-based CPUs for better control and cost efficiency.
Custom Neoverse chips will include a new protocol for seamless data transfer with GPUs, crucial for generative AI workloads.
This move highlights Nvidia's strategy of partnering across the tech industry, placing it at the center of the AI revolution.
Softbank, Arm's majority owner, recently liquidated its Nvidia stake and is backing the OpenAI Stargate project, which will use chips from Arm, Nvidia, and AMD.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, big news coming out of the tech world! Arm just announced a significant move that's going to shake things up in the AI chip space. Their central processing units, based on Arm technology, will now be able to integrate directly with AI chips using Nvidia's cutting-edge NVLink Fusion technology. This is a game-changer, especially for those massive hyperscalers and other customers who love to customize their infrastructure. It means they'll have an easier time pairing their Arm-based Neoverse CPUs with Nvidia's incredibly powerful graphics processing units. What's really interesting here is that Nvidia is making a strategic shift, opening up its NVLink platform to integrate with a broader range of custom chips. This is a departure from them primarily pushing their own CPUs, signaling a more open approach to collaboration in the AI industry. We're already seeing tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google developing and deploying Arm-based CPUs in their cloud environments. They're doing this to gain more control over their setups and, let's be honest, to save some money! Arm isn't a chip manufacturer itself, but they license their essential instruction set technology and sell designs that help partners build these Arm-based chips quickly. As part of this latest announcement, custom Neoverse chips will feature a brand new protocol, enabling them to move data seamlessly with GPUs. While the CPU has traditionally been the heart of a server, the generative AI revolution has shifted the focus to AI accelerator chips, predominantly Nvidia GPUs, which can be paired with up to eight GPUs in an AI server. It's also worth noting that Nvidia has a history of strategic partnerships, even investing in Intel last September to integrate Intel CPUs into AI servers using NVLink. And in a bit of a twist, Softbank, the majority owner of Arm, recently sold off its entire stake in Nvidia. Softbank is now backing the ambitious OpenAI Stargate project, which plans to leverage a mix of Arm technology alongside chips from both Nvidia and AMD. This is all happening as Nvidia continues to be at the absolute epicenter of the booming AI industry.
