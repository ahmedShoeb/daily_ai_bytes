## Key Points

Anthropic has released Claude Sonnet 4.5, which is a significant upgrade over Opus 4.1, offering improved speed, steerability, and reliability.
Sonnet 4.5 demonstrates noticeable speed, completing a large code review in approximately two minutes, significantly faster than GPT-5 Codex.
It performs well in long-running agentic tasks, handling complex data like spreadsheets to generate investor updates and resolving bugs that previous versions couldn't.
The enhanced performance is attributed to better adherence to prompts (steerability), improved context management in large codebases, increased determinism, and a more concise output style.
While highly capable, GPT-5 Codex still outperforms Sonnet 4.5 in the most challenging production coding tasks, particularly in catching hard-to-find edge cases.
For users of Claude Code as their primary programming tool, Sonnet 4.5 is a substantial upgrade, enhancing daily workflow and efficiency.
Assuming similar pricing to Sonnet 4, Sonnet 4.5 offers a more cost-effective and powerful alternative to Opus 4.1, although GPT-5 remains significantly cheaper.

## Key Topics Discussed

Anthropic has recently launched Claude Sonnet 4.5, which marks a notable advancement over its predecessor, Opus 4.1. This new version is lauded for being considerably faster, more steerable, and more reliable, particularly within the Claude Code environment. In head-to-head comparisons, Sonnet 4.5 efficiently handles large pull request reviews in minutes, demonstrates strong multi-file reasoning without losing focus, and maintains conciseness when instructed. Users have reported it feeling approximately 50 percent faster than previous Claude versions, which greatly enhances the pairing experience for developers. 

Beyond speed, Sonnet 4.5 exhibits strong performance in long-running agentic tasks. It can process multiple spreadsheets to generate comprehensive documents like investor updates with minimal editing, and has successfully resolved complex bugs that Opus 4.1 could not. This performance jump is a result of improved steerability, allowing it to better adhere to prompt directions, superior context management in large codebases, increased determinism, and a more focused and terse output style, akin to GPT-5. However, for the most intricate production coding challenges, GPT-5 Codex still holds an advantage, having caught edge cases that Sonnet 4.5 missed in tests. 

Despite this, Sonnet 4.5 is considered an exciting leap for day-to-day builders. Individuals who use Claude Code as their primary programming interface will find Sonnet 4.5 to be a significant enhancement. While it may not convert staunch GPT-5 Codex users, it is recommended for new projects,
