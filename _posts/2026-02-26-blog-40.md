## Key Points

IBM's share price dropped 13% following an Anthropic blog post highlighting how AI can accelerate COBOL code refactoring
Anthropic pointed out that COBOL remains prevalent in critical government, airline, and financial applications
COBOL-proficient programmers are scarce and training efforts haven't expanded the developer pool
Anthropic's Claude Code tool can assess which components are safe to migrate and document technical debt
IBM itself launched 'watsonx Code Assistant for Z' in 2023 for COBOL-to-Java conversions using AI
Despite AI migration tools, IBM recently reported its highest mainframe revenue in 20 years
CEO Arvind Krishna credits AI conversion tools and mainframes' low operating costs for the revenue boost
The UK government recently complained about high costs to maintain aging COBOL systems
Other tech companies like AWS, Microsoft, and Kyndryl are also pursuing mainframe migration initiatives
The stock drop coincided with broader market concerns about AI disrupting SaaS business models
