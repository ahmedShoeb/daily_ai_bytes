Hey podcast listeners! Get ready to revolutionize your travel planning, because Google is rolling out some seriously cool AI upgrades in Search. They're introducing new features designed to take the stress out of building itineraries, finding deals, and even making bookings. First up, there's 'Canvas' in AI Mode, a brilliant tool that gives you a space to organize all your travel ideas. Just tell AI Mode your trip preferences, and Canvas will whip up a personalized plan, pulling in real-time flight and hotel data, Google Maps details like photos and reviews, and relevant info from across the web. You can then refine your plan by asking follow-up questions, like comparing hotels based on proximity to different activities. Currently, Canvas for travel planning is available on desktop in the U.S. for those opted into the AI Mode experiment in Labs. But wait, there's more! Google is also globally expanding 'Flight Deals,' an AI-powered tool within Google Flights. This is perfect for flexible travelers looking to snag bargains. Just describe where, when, and how you want to travel, and Flight Deals will understand your needs and show you the best available options. It's now rolling out to over 200 countries and territories, supporting more than 60 languages. And for the ultimate convenience, Google is enhancing AI Mode with 'agentic capabilities' to streamline bookings. This means AI Mode can now help you book restaurant reservations, event tickets, or even beauty appointments! You describe what you're looking for, and AI Mode will search across multiple platforms like OpenTable, Ticketmaster, and Booksy to find real-time availability. It'll then present a curated list with direct links to finalize your booking. Agentic booking for restaurants is already rolling out in the U.S., no Labs opt-in required for that one! Looking ahead, Google is working to bring direct flight and hotel bookings right into AI Mode. They're collaborating with major industry partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Marriott, and others to create an experience where you can compare options, refine your choices, and complete bookings all in one place.
