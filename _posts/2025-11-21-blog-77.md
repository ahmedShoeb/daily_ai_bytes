## Key Points

Google has launched Antigravity, a new development tool that uses Gemini 3 Pro and other third-party models.
Antigravity is designed for an 'agent-first future,' providing multiple agents with direct access to editor, terminal, and browser.
It generates 'Artifacts' like task lists, plans, screenshots, and browser recordings to verify its work.
The tool offers two main views: an Editor view for an IDE-like experience and a Manager view for orchestrating multiple agents.
Users can give feedback on specific Artifacts, and agents can learn from past work and retain code snippets.
Antigravity is available in public preview for Windows, macOS, and Linux, is free to use with generous rate limits, and supports Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and OpenAI’s GPT-OSS.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, we've got some exciting news from Google! Alongside the announcement of Gemini 3 Pro, they've unveiled a brand new development tool called Antigravity. This isn't just any coding tool; it's built for an 'agent-first future,' leveraging Gemini 3 Pro and even other third-party AI models. Imagine having a coding assistant that gives you direct access to your editor, terminal, and browser, with the capability to manage multiple agents simultaneously. That's what Antigravity aims to deliver!

One of the coolest features is how it proves its work. Google calls them 'Artifacts'—think of them as task lists, plans, screenshots, and even browser recordings that verify what the agents have done and what they plan to do next. This makes it super easy for you to keep tabs on the AI's progress without getting bogged down in every single action it takes. Antigravity also sports two primary views. There's the familiar Editor view, which gives you that classic Integrated Development Environment feel, complete with an agent in a side panel, much like tools you might already be using. But then there's the Manager view, which is like mission control for your AI agents! It's designed for orchestrating multiple agents across different workspaces in parallel, allowing them to work more autonomously. Plus, Google has made it easier to give feedback to these AI agents. You can leave comments directly on specific Artifacts, and the agent will take that feedback into account without disrupting its current task. And get this: these agents can actually learn from their past work, retaining code snippets and task steps to improve over time. Antigravity is in public preview right now, compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it's free to use with generous rate limits for Gemini 3 Pro. It even supports other models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 and OpenAI’s GPT-OSS. So if you're into coding and AI, this is definitely something to check out!
