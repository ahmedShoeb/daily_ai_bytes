## Key Points

- Freenode, once the largest IRC network for open-source communities, has been bought from its previous owner and will be transferred to the community-owned Freenode Foundation
- The network will be reset to its 2021 state before the previous owner's controversial takeover
- Andrew Lee, the previous owner, purchased the network in May 2021 and faced backlash for rebranding it as 'Libera.Chat' and allegedly holding the network hostage
- The new ownership aims to restore Freenode's original mission of supporting open-source software and community collaboration
- This acquisition marks a significant turnaround for one of the internet's oldest and most important IRC networks
