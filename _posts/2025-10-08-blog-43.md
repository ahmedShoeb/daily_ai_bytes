## Key Points

- Google is testing a new Gemini home screen redesign.
- The redesign adds a scrollable feed of one-tap prompt suggestions.
- Prompts range from image edits to news, quizzes, and coding.
- The new UI aims to make Gemini's home screen feel more like a discovery feed.

## Key Topics Discussed

An APK teardown has revealed that Google is testing a significant redesign for the Gemini app's home screen. The current minimalistic interface could be replaced with a scrollable feed of suggested prompts, offering a more engaging and exploratory user experience. These one-tap prompt suggestions cover a wide range of Gemini's capabilities, including image editing, daily news summaries, educational quizzes, and coding tasks. This new design, found in Google app version 16.38.62.sa.arm64, indicates a shift towards a 'discovery feed' model, akin to how users interact with many other apps in 2025. While this feature is currently in testing, it provides insight into Google's vision for Gemini's future interface, aiming to make it less of a launchpad and more of a dynamic content feed. However, it is important to note that, as with all teardowns, there is no guarantee that this redesign will be widely implemented.
