## Key Topics Discussed

Grammarly is expanding its AI capabilities with the introduction of a comprehensive suite of nine new AI agents, catering to the evolving needs of students and educators. These specialized tools are now accessible to Grammarly Free and Pro users within Grammarly's newly launched "AI-native writing surface," Grammarly Docs, without any additional cost. A standout feature among these new agents is the AI grader. This innovative tool can provide students with a predicted grade for their papers and offer tailored writing recommendations. It achieves this by analyzing uploaded course details and leveraging publicly available information about the instructor, thereby enabling students to refine their work before submission. Beyond grading, Grammarly's new AI agents address various aspects of the writing process. Students can utilize tools such as the reader reactions agent to anticipate potential questions from their audience, a proofreader agent for in-line writing suggestions, and a paraphrase agent to adjust text for different tones and styles. For academic integrity, a citation finder agent automatically generates correctly formatted citations, while an expert review agent offers personalized, topic-specific feedback. Grammarly has also developed tools specifically for educators to streamline their review processes. The plagiarism checker agent can scan extensive databases, academic papers, and websites to identify similarities in writing submissions. Additionally, an AI detector agent provides a score to indicate the likelihood of a text being human-written or AI-generated, assisting educators in maintaining academic standards. While currently available for Grammarly Pro users, the AI and plagiarism detector agents are slated for release to Enterprise and Education users later in the year, alongside future new agents. This initiative underscores Grammarly's commitment to integrating advanced AI into its platform to foster better writing outcomes and prepare users for an increasingly AI-literate professional landscape.
