## Key Points

OpenAI is developing a Group Chats feature for ChatGPT, enabling multiple users to participate in a shared conversation with both other users and the AI.
The feature is expected to include custom controls, such as the ability to customize system prompts for group discussions and manage when the AI responds (automatically or when tagged).
These controls suggest an emphasis on structured collaboration, targeting professional and academic users seeking tailored environments.
While similar to Microsoft Copilot's group features, OpenAI aims for more granular management over AI involvement and group behavior.
The release of Group Chats is anticipated around December, potentially coinciding with OpenAI's "12 days of OpenAI" event.
The feature is currently under development, with its full functionality and limitations yet to be confirmed.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, exciting news from the AI world! It looks like OpenAI is gearing up to introduce a brand-new Group Chats feature for ChatGPT. Imagine this: you, your team, and ChatGPT all in one shared conversation, interacting seamlessly. This is a big step towards enhancing collaboration, allowing multiple users to chat with each other and the AI within a single feed. What's really interesting is that OpenAI isn't just stopping at basic group functionality. They're planning to implement some pretty neat custom controls. We're talking about the ability to customize the system prompt specifically for your group discussions and even manage when the AI jumps in to respond – either automatically or only when it's explicitly mentioned or tagged. This level of customization really points towards a focus on structured collaboration, making it super easy for teams to brainstorm, coordinate projects, or solve problems without constantly switching contexts. While Microsoft has a similar feature in Copilot, OpenAI seems to be aiming for more granular control over how the AI participates and how the group behaves, which could be a huge draw for professionals and academics needing a more tailored collaborative environment. Given OpenAI's pattern of rolling out new features around December, it's very possible we could see Group Chats launch as part of their "12 days of OpenAI" event before the year is out. Of course, it's still under development, so the full details and capabilities are yet to be revealed. But this move definitely strengthens ChatGPT's position as a powerful productivity tool for teams and group workflows, and I, for one, can't wait to see it in action!
