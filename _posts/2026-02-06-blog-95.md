title: "Lightpanda: The Ultra-Lightweight Open-Source Browser Built for Headless Usage"
blog_url: https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser 
---



## Key Points

- Lightpanda is an **open-source browser** designed specifically for **headless usage**, meaning it doesn’t need a graphical interface to run.
- It supports **JavaScript execution** and a **subset of Web APIs**, making it powerful for automation, AI training, scraping, and testing.
- Lightpanda is **compatible with Playwright, Puppeteer, and chromedp** through its Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) support.
- It boasts an **exceptionally low memory footprint**—**9 times less than Chrome**—and runs **11 times faster** on tasks like fetching pages.
- Installation is straightforward via **nightly builds** for Linux, MacOS, and even **Windows with WSL2**, or through **Docker images**.
- By default, Lightpanda collects **usage telemetry**, but this can be disabled with an environment variable for privacy.
- The project is **still in beta**, so stability and full feature coverage are ongoing improvements. Users may encounter errors or crashes.
- Lightpanda is **built from scratch using Zig**, a low-level programming language optimized for performance, rather than relying on Chromium or WebKit.
- It’s **opinionated for headless use**, meaning it skips unnecessary graphical features, making it leaner and more efficient.
- The project welcomes **contributions via pull requests**, but contributors must sign a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** first.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, today we’re diving into something really exciting in the world of web automation and headless browsing: **Lightpanda**. If you’ve ever struggled with running Chrome or other traditional browsers at scale for tasks like scraping, testing, or training AI models, this project might just be a game-changer for you. Lightpanda is an open-source browser built from the ground up for headless usage, meaning it doesn’t need a graphical interface to function. That’s right—it’s designed to be lightweight, fast, and efficient without all the bloat that comes with a full desktop browser like Chrome or Firefox, especially when you’re running it on servers or in cloud environments like AWS EC2 instances or Docker containers where every bit of memory and CPU counts matters a lot more than on your local machine. So, why reinvent the wheel? Well, in this case, they’re not. Lightpanda isn’t based on Chromium, Blink, or WebKit. Instead, it’s built using **Zig**, a low-level programming language that’s all about performance and optimization. This approach allows them to strip away everything that isn’t needed for headless operations, like graphical rendering, and focus on what truly matters: **JavaScript execution, Web API support, and speed**. And oh boy, does it deliver on speed! According to their benchmarks, Lightpanda can fetch pages **11 times faster** than Chrome and uses **9 times less memory**. That’s a massive improvement, especially if you’re running hundreds or thousands of instances for web scraping or testing. It’s also super easy to install and get started. You’ve got options: you can grab the latest nightly build for Linux, MacOS, or even run it on Windows inside WSL2. Or, if you’re a Docker fan, they’ve got official images ready for you. Once installed, you can connect tools like Puppeteer or Playwright to Lightpanda’s CDP server, and they’ll work seamlessly with it. It’s like having the power of a full browser without the overhead. Now, I know what you’re thinking—what about all those fancy JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular? Lightpanda has got you covered there too, with support for **Ajax, Single Page Apps, infinite loading, and more**. It’s not just about speed and memory; it’s about being able to handle modern web applications that rely heavily on JavaScript. But, as with any beta project, there are some caveats. Lightpanda is still a work in progress, and while it’s improving rapidly, you might run into some errors or crashes depending on the website you’re trying to scrape or interact with. They’re actively working on expanding its support for Web APIs, so if something doesn’t work, it’s likely just a matter of time before it’s fixed. They also encourage users to open issues on GitHub if they encounter problems. Another cool feature is that Lightpanda collects usage telemetry by default, but you can easily disable it by setting an environment variable. It’s a great way to help them improve while keeping your privacy intact if you choose to opt out. And if you’re into contributing to open-source projects, Lightpanda welcomes pull requests! Just remember to sign their CLA first. So, whether you’re into AI, web scraping, automated testing, or just love the idea of a lean, mean, headless browser machine, Lightpanda is definitely worth keeping an eye on. It’s pushing the boundaries of what we can do with headless browsers, and the potential applications are endless. Stay tuned, because this is a project that’s only going to get better with time!
