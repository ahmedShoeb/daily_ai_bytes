## Key Points

AI-powered search engines, like Google's AI Overviews and Gemini, tend to cite less popular websites than traditional search results.
Research from Ruhr University and Max Planck Institute compared AI search tools with traditional Google search.
Many sources cited by AI search engines, particularly Gemini, fall outside the top 1,000 or even top 1,000,000 domains tracked by Tranco.
Over half of the sources in Google's AI Overviews didn't appear in the top 10 Google links for the same query, and 40% were outside the top 100.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, welcome back to the podcast! We've got some interesting news today regarding how AI is shaking up the world of search engines. You know how Google's AI Overviews had a bit of a rocky start? Well, new research is shedding more light on just how different AI-powered search results are from what we're used to. It turns out that these AI search engines, including Google's AI Overviews, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and even GPT-4o's web search, tend to pull information from less popular websites. We're talking about sites that often wouldn't even crack the top 100 links in a traditional, organic Google search!

Researchers from Ruhr University and the Max Planck Institute dove deep into this, comparing the citation habits of these AI tools with standard Google search. What they found is pretty significant: the sources cited by AI engines are generally less popular, often falling outside the top 1,000 or even top 1,000,000 domains tracked by services like Tranco. Gemini search, in particular, showed a strong tendency to cite these less-trafficked domains. This means that a substantial portion of the information you're getting from AI-powered search might be coming from places you'd never encounter through a typical web search. For instance, over half of the sources in Google's AI Overviews didn't even make it into the top 10 Google links for the same query, and a whopping 40% weren't even in the top 100. It really makes you think about the shift in information sourcing that generative AI is bringing to the table, and how it's potentially exposing us to a different slice of the internet.
