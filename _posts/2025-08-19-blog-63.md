---

## Overview

Void is an open-source AI code editor, forked from VS Code, that allows users to leverage AI agents on their codebase, visualize changes, and integrate with any local or cloud-based LLM. It prioritizes data privacy by sending messages directly to providers without retaining user data.

## Key Points

- Void is an open-source AI code editor.
- It is a fork of the VS Code repository.
- Features include AI agents for codebase interaction, change checkpointing, and visualization.
- Supports direct connections to any LLM (local or cloud).
- Emphasizes full data privacy with no backend middleman, sending messages directly to providers.
- Development is temporarily paused to experiment with new AI coding ideas.

## Key Topics Discussed

Void is presented as an open-source alternative to Cursor, functioning as an AI-powered code editor. Built upon the foundation of the VS Code repository, Void allows developers to integrate AI agents directly into their coding workflows. Key functionalities include the ability to apply AI agents to codebases, track and visualize changes through checkpointing, and connect to a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs), whether hosted locally or in the cloud. A core principle of Void is its commitment to data privacy; it operates without a backend middleman, directly transmitting user data to the chosen AI providers, thereby ensuring that no personal data is retained by the editor itself. The project currently has its development on hold as the team explores and experiments with novel AI coding concepts. For community engagement and updates, users are directed to the project's website and Discord channel. The repository also provides resources for contributors, including a guide on how to contribute and a codebase guide. Void is licensed under Apache-2.0, reflecting its open-source nature. The project has garnered significant interest, as indicated by its substantial number of stars and forks on GitHub.
