## Key Points

Gemini 3 offers significant improvements, particularly in creative writing, producing content that doesn't feel like 'AI slop'.
The model shows enhanced consistency, reducing the 'spikiness' of quality seen in previous AI models and acting as a more skilled collaborator.
Gemini 3 excels in complex reasoning and subtle creative tasks, though for everyday tasks, the difference might not be immediately noticeable.
It is remarkably fast and efficient ('intelligence per second'), often outperforming GPT-5 Pro in speed while maintaining quality.
Gemini 3 possesses a direct, terse personality, delivering answers without excessive preambles, and is highly adaptable to specific persona prompts.
The Antigravity IDE, a real development environment with browser integration, is impressive but requires user supervision to ensure tasks are fully completed and verified.
The author has adopted Gemini 3 as their new daily driver, noting its brilliant, almost humanly accurate results when correct, and anticipating its success due to Google's ability to serve it stably and affordably.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright everyone, let's dive into a review of Gemini 3 from Shumer.dev, and what's cool is that this review isn't just about those wild benchmark numbers everyone else is obsessing over. Instead, the author, who's been hands-on with Gemini 3 for a few days, is really focusing on how it *feels* to use in practice – and that's what we love to hear!

The big standout, right off the bat, is its creative writing. The author was absolutely floored, saying Gemini 3 wrote book chapters that felt so authentic, they had to double-check they weren't plagiarized. It's not just 'good for AI' writing; it's genuinely good writing that avoids that familiar 'AI slop' feeling. This points to what the author calls fundamental improvements, particularly in consistency. Gone are the 'spiky' results where quality varied wildly; Gemini 3 feels much more like a skilled, consistent collaborator.

Now, here's an interesting point: for a lot of your daily tasks, you might not notice a massive leap. Writing emails or minor web app tweaks are already pretty good with current models. But the real magic of Gemini 3, according to the review, hides in that difficult 20% – the complex reasoning, the subtle creative choices, those edge cases where other models fall apart. That's where its extra brainpower truly shines.

And get this, it's fast! The author mentions an 'intelligence per second' metric, and Gemini 3 is fantastic in that regard. It often outperformed GPT-5 Pro in regular mode, and did so without a 5-10 minute wait. So you're getting both quality and speed, which can totally change your workflow.

Personality-wise, Gemini 3 is a bit different. It's less ingratiating, more terse and direct. It gives you the answer and largely stops, which the author prefers – no need to scroll through verbose explanations to find the core content. Plus, it's incredibly adaptable; if you ask it to write something in a specific, unique style, it nails it without fighting you.

Then there's the Antigravity IDE, which is described as impressive for a launch product, feeling like a real dev environment with genuinely useful browser integration. It can spin up servers, check goals, and iterate. However, it's not a magic button; you still need to babysit it. The model might declare victory too soon, so you need to keep logs open and explicitly tell it to verify its work. Custom instructions can help here, like telling it to keep reading logs until it's sure things are working.

Overall, the author sums it up by saying if GPT-5.1 is a solid junior engineer, Gemini 3 is a senior engineer who says 'got it, done,' but you still need to double-check that it's *actually* done. Despite this, it's become their new daily driver because when it's right, it's brilliantly, almost humanly right. With Google's computing power, serving this cheaply and stably, the author bets it's going to be a winner!
