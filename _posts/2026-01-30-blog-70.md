## Key Topics Discussed

Hey listeners, today we’re diving into a fresh development from Intuition Robotics, the folks behind the award‑winning ElliQ companion robot. They’ve just rolled out an ElliQ Caregiver Solution—a two‑part system that couples the familiar ElliQ robot with a brand‑new Caregiver App. The goal? To give the 48 million unpaid caregivers across the United States a smarter, more hands‑off way to look after older adults. 

The ElliQ robot stays in the senior’s home, offering daily social interaction, health nudges, and activity prompts, while also monitoring key metrics. When something noteworthy happens—say a shift in mobility or a missed medication—the robot sends an AI‑generated alert straight to the caregiver’s app. That app lets family members or professional aides set personalized care goals, track health and activity data, and get proactive updates without having to be on‑site. 

Why does this matter? Caregiver burnout is a real crisis—over 60 % of caregivers report feeling exhausted, and many sacrifice income or even leave the workforce to provide care. By automating routine monitoring and communication, ElliQ frees up caregivers to focus on the emotional side of caregiving rather than getting bogged down in logistics. 

Company leaders, including CEO Dor Skuler, emphasized that this isn’t just a gadget; it’s a holistic approach that integrates the older adult’s entire care network. The solution also taps into the broader AgeTech movement, where tech innovators are building tools specifically for an aging population. 

In short, Intuition Robotics is positioning ElliQ as a live‑in AI caregiver that supports both seniors and the people who love them, promising greater independence for older adults and a lighter load for the invisible backbone of our economy—caregivers.
