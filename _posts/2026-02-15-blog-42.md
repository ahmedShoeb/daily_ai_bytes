## Key Topics Discussed

The paper presents a significant advancement in AI's capability for autonomous mathematics research with the introduction of Aletheia, a sophisticated math research agent. While current AI systems have reached gold-medal standards in competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad, Aletheia represents a major leap toward professional research capabilities by navigating extensive mathematical literature and constructing complex, long-horizon proofs. The system operates by iteratively generating, verifying, and revising solutions completely in natural language, powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems and supported by a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level mathematics. The researchers demonstrate Aletheia's capabilities across multiple challenging domains, including Olympiad problems and PhD-level exercises, with particular emphasis on three groundbreaking achievements in AI-assisted mathematics. First, the AI autonomously generated a complete research paper on calculating structure constants called eigenweights in arithmetic geometry, representing fully autonomous mathematical research without human intervention. Second, a human-AI collaborative effort produced another research paper proving bounds on systems of interacting particles known as independent sets, showcasing effective partnership between human researchers and AI systems. Third, in an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation of 700 open problems from Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, Aletheia autonomously solved four previously open mathematical questions, demonstrating practical research utility. To foster understanding and transparency in AI-assisted mathematics, the authors propose quantifying standard levels of autonomy and novelty for AI contributions, along with introducing human-AI interaction cards that document collaboration processes. The paper concludes with reflections on the evolving nature of human-AI collaboration in mathematics and makes all prompts and model outputs publicly available to support further research and development in this rapidly advancing field.
