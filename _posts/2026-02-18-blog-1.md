## Key Points

- Web browsing in Lockdown Mode is limited to cached content to prevent live network requests
- Lockdown Mode is available for ChatGPT Enterprise, Edu, Healthcare, and Teachers editions
- Elevated Risk labels are being added to certain capabilities across ChatGPT, ChatGPT Atlas, and Codex
- These labels warn users about features that may introduce additional security risks
- OpenAI plans to make Lockdown Mode available to consumers in the coming months
- The new protections build on existing security measures like sandboxing and enterprise controls
- OpenAI will continue to strengthen safeguards and update risk labels as security advances
