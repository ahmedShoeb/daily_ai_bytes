## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, exciting news out of Emerson Collective's 2025 Demo Day! OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple design guru Jony Ive just confirmed they've settled on a design for their first mysterious AI hardware device and are actively prototyping it. While they're keeping the super-fine details under wraps, Ive mentioned we could see this new gadget arrive in 'less than' two years. 

Now, what do we know about it? Not a ton, but the buzz is it'll be screen-free and roughly the size of a smartphone. Altman's really hyped about the design, calling it 'simple and beautiful and playful.' He even shared that after some earlier prototypes, they finally hit on something he felt an immediate connection to, saying he wanted to 'pick up that thing and take a bite out of it.' 

Ive echoed that sentiment, emphasizing his love for solutions that seem almost naive in their simplicity, yet are incredibly sophisticated. He wants users to feel no intimidation, to use the product almost carelessly, like a natural extension of themselves. It sounds like they're really aiming for something intuitive and delightful. Altman's hope is that when people see it, they'll just get it, saying 'That's it!', and Ive confidently agrees they will. Get ready for what sounds like a groundbreaking new piece of AI tech!
