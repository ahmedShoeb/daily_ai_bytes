## Key Points

- Power sampling from base models performs comparably or better than RL-posttraining on various reasoning tasks.
- Benchmarks used include MATH500, HumanEval, GPQA Diamond, and AlpacaEval 2.0.
- Power sampling is effective in-domain (MATH500) and can outperform out-of-domain (HumanEval, AlpacaEval 2.0).
- This approach achieves strong results without modifying the base model's weights.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! We're diving into a fascinating new approach today called 'power sampling' that's making waves in how language models handle reasoning tasks. This article highlights that by simply using power sampling directly from base models, we can achieve results that are as good as, if not better than, those from models that have undergone extensive Reinforcement Learning-based post-training, or RL-posttraining. They put this to the test on some seriously tough benchmarks, including MATH500 for complex math problems, HumanEval for coding challenges, GPQA Diamond for advanced science questions, and even AlpacaEval 2.0 for general helpfulness. What's really cool is that power sampling manages to pull off these impressive gains without having to change the base model's weights at all. This is a big deal, especially when you compare it to methods like GRPO, a popular RL-posttraining technique. The research showed strong performance right within the expected domain, and it actually outperformed other methods when tackling problems outside of the training domain. It's definitely something to keep an eye on!
