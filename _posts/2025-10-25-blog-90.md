## Key Points

Language agents aim to learn and improve from their own experience for complex, real-world tasks.
Training agents with reinforcement learning from experience data is difficult due to lack of verifiable rewards or inefficient long-horizon rollouts.
Most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which has scaling and generalization issues.
This paper introduces 'early experience,' where agents generate their own interaction data, using future states as supervision without explicit reward signals.
Two strategies explored within early experience are implicit world modeling (grounding policy in environment dynamics) and self-reflection (improving reasoning from suboptimal actions).
The proposed approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization across eight diverse environments and multiple model families.
Early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, bridging imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, we've got a fascinating new paper to talk about today that dives into how AI agents can learn more effectively from their own experiences. The big challenge for language agents is getting them to continuously improve and eventually outperform humans in really complex, real-world scenarios. But, getting these agents to learn from experience using traditional reinforcement learning can be super tricky, especially when there aren't clear rewards or when tasks are really long and drawn out. Think about trying to navigate a website or using multiple tools in a sequence â€“ it's hard to get good feedback. Currently, many agents rely on learning from expert demonstrations, which sounds great, but it's tough to scale up and doesn't always generalize well to new situations. The problem is that these expert examples only cover a small slice of what the agent might encounter. So, this paper introduces a really neat concept called 'early experience.' Instead of waiting for clear rewards, agents generate their *own* interaction data, and the future states they encounter act as a form of supervision. It's like learning by doing, even without a teacher giving you a grade! They looked at two main ways to use this 'early experience.' First, there's 'implicit world modeling,' where the agent uses the states it collects to understand the environment's dynamics. And second, 'self-reflection,' where the agent actually learns from its own mistakes or less-than-optimal actions to get better at reasoning and making decisions. They tested these methods across eight different environments and various model families, and the results are pretty exciting. Their approaches consistently showed better effectiveness and, importantly, improved generalization to situations they hadn't seen before. The researchers are really optimistic that this 'early experience' approach can be a solid foundation for future reinforcement learning, essentially creating a practical bridge between learning from examples and agents that are fully driven by their own experiences. It sounds like a big step towards more robust and adaptive AI!
