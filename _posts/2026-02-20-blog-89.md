## Key Points

Claude Sonnet 4.6 is Anthropic's most capable Sonnet model yet, featuring major upgrades across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design.
The model includes a 1M token context window in beta, enough to hold entire codebases or dozens of research papers in a single request.
Pricing remains the same as Sonnet 4.5 at $3/$15 per million tokens, and it's now the default model for Free and Pro plans on claude.ai and Claude Cowork.
Sonnet 4.6 shows significant coding improvements - developers with early access preferred it over Sonnet 4.5 by wide margins, and even preferred it to Opus 4.5 (November 2025's frontier model) 59% of the time.
The model demonstrates human-level capability in computer use tasks like navigating complex spreadsheets and filling multi-step web forms, with major improvements in resistance to prompt injection attacks.
Performance-to-cost ratio is described as 'extraordinary,' with Sonnet 4.6 approaching Opus-level intelligence at a much more practical price point for real-world tasks.
Early users reported notable improvements in frontend code quality, financial analysis, design sensibilities, and required fewer iterations to reach production-quality results.
The model excels at complex agentic workloads, bug detection, document comprehension (matching Opus 4.6 on OfficeQA), and shows strong performance on enterprise tasks like insurance workflows and contract routing.
Claude Sonnet 4.6 is available now across all Claude plans, Claude Cowork, Claude Code, the API, and major cloud platforms, with free tier also upgraded to Sonnet 4.6 by default.
Safety evaluations show Sonnet 4.6 is as safe as or safer than other recent Claude models, with researchers describing it as having 'a broadly warm, honest, prosocial, and at times funny character.'
