## Key Points

- Perplexity is quietly expanding its Comet browser with new local connector capabilities building on previously discovered MCP support
- A Mac-specific connector for Apple's Messages app has surfaced, allowing Comet assistant to pull message context into conversations when prompted
- This represents the first platform-native local integration carrying an explicit 'Local' label
- The feature is not yet available to users and has no confirmed release timeline
- A new 'Usage and Credits' settings area has appeared in development builds to let users view spending limits and purchase additional credits
- The credits system is similar to Anthropic's credit system for Claude
- Between late 2025 and early 2026, Perplexity drastically reduced Pro plan limits (Deep Research queries went from ~500/day to as few as 20/month)
- The credits system would give Pro subscribers who hit caps a way to buy additional capacity without upgrading to the $200/month Max tier
- This could ease backlash from annual subscribers who felt shortchanged by sudden reductions
