## Key Points

- Simile has raised $100 million in funding to develop AI tools that predict human behavior
- The company emerged from stealth this week after months of developing AI models trained on interviews with hundreds of people
- The AI system was trained on data including historic transactions and scientific journals about behavioral experiments
- Simile uses simulations populated by AI agents that represent the preferences of actual people
- CVS is testing Simile's service to help guide decisions about which products to stock and display
- The company's approach offers businesses an alternative to traditional focus groups for learning consumer preferences
- The technology aims to foresee decisions someone might make in any given situation
- Traditional AI optimizes for efficiency and accuracy, while humans make decisions shaped by culture, social norms, and lived experience
- Research suggests AI could learn values by observing human behavior in different cultural contexts

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey there podcast listeners! Today we're diving into a fascinating development in the AI space that's all about predicting human behavior. Simile, an AI startup, just raised a massive $100 million to develop tools that help companies predict human behavior - think guessing which products consumers might buy or anticipating questions analysts might ask during earnings calls.

Now what makes Simile really interesting is their approach. They've been working quietly for months, training their AI model on interviews with hundreds of people about their lives. They've also fed it data on historical transactions and text from scientific journals dealing with behavioral experiments. This combination allows them to create simulations populated by AI agents that represent the preferences of actual people.

Here's where it gets practical - CVS is already testing Simile's service to help make decisions about which products to stock and display. This represents a potential game-changer for businesses looking for alternatives to traditional focus groups. Instead of gathering people in a room, companies could use AI simulations to predict consumer preferences.

The article touches on a really important point about how traditional AI differs from human decision-making. While AI typically optimizes for efficiency, accuracy, and speed, human decisions are shaped by culture, social norms, and lived experience - factors that are rarely captured in algorithmic design. Simile's approach aims to bridge that gap by creating AI that better understands these human elements.

There's also some really interesting research mentioned from the University of Washington suggesting that machines could learn values by seeing how people behave in different cultural contexts. This could lead to AI that's not only more contextually aware but also more trustworthy to diverse groups of users.

In related AI news, we're seeing conversational AI increasingly supplanting traditional search in various categories like shopping and financial workflows. Data shows that power users of AI were almost a third more likely in December than November to say they'd replaced old search methods with AI-driven alternatives, with nearly half of them reporting using AI instead of traditional approaches for purchasing decisions.

This development with Simile represents a significant step toward AI that doesn't just process information but actually understands and predicts human behavior - something that could transform how businesses make decisions and interact with consumers.
