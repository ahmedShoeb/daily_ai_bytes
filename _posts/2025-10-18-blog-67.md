## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, got some exciting news from Anthropic! They've just dropped Claude Haiku 4.5, their newest small model, and it's available right now to all of us. This is a pretty big deal because Haiku 4.5 is delivering performance similar to what we saw with Claude Sonnet 4, but get this – it's at a third of the cost and over twice as fast! This makes it a fantastic option for anything needing quick responses, like chat assistants, customer service, or even when you're doing some intense pair programming.

Claude Haiku 4.5 isn't just fast and affordable; it's also incredibly capable. It actually surpasses Sonnet 4 in tasks involving computer use and hits an impressive 90% of Sonnet 4.5's performance in agentic coding evaluations, putting it on par with much larger models. What's even cooler is that you can use it alongside models like Sonnet 4.5 – imagine Sonnet breaking down a big problem and then having a team of Haiku 4.5s tackle all the smaller subtasks in parallel. Talk about efficiency!

And for those of us concerned about safety, Anthropic has really stepped up. Claude Haiku 4.5 is showing significantly lower rates of concerning behaviors and is more aligned than its predecessor. In fact, by some metrics, it's their safest model yet, even outperforming Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 in terms of misaligned behaviors. It's been released under the AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) standard, which means it poses very limited risks for things like CBRN weapons.

If you're a developer, you can get your hands on Claude Haiku 4.5 through the Claude API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. They've also updated the pricing to be super economical at just $1 per million input tokens and $5 per million output tokens. For all the nitty-gritty technical details and safety evaluations, make sure to check out their system card and documentation. This sounds like a game-changer for accessible, high-performance AI!
