## Key Topics Discussed

Hey listeners, today we’re diving into the buzz around Mistral, the French AI startup that’s quickly become Europe’s answer to OpenAI. Launched just last year by former DeepMind and Meta researchers, Mistral is focused on open‑source large language models and even rolled out its own chatbot, “Le Chat,” which it claims runs faster than competing systems. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, co‑founder and CEO Arthur Mensch made it clear that Mistral isn’t looking for a buyer – the plan is to go public via an IPO. The company has already raised more than €1 billion, including a €600 million round in June that valued it at €6.2 billion. Mensch also announced expansion moves: a new office in Singapore and a push to grow its footprint across the US and Europe, leveraging Europe’s strong talent pool. Mistral recently secured a contract with a NASDAQ‑listed blue‑chip firm and struck a multi‑million‑euro licensing deal with Agence France‑Presse to feed its chatbot with news content, mirroring deals OpenAI has made with Axel Springer, News Corp, and the Financial Times. With a hiring spree in Palo Alto and a clear ambition to compete with the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic, Mistral is positioning itself as the sole European contender in the high‑stakes LLM race. Stay tuned as we watch whether this IPO strategy pays off and how it might reshape the AI landscape in Europe and beyond.
