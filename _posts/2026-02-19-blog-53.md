## Key Points

The report focuses on the current state and future trajectory of Agentic AI in 2026
Agentic AI projects are rapidly advancing from experimentation to autonomous operations across organizations
Complexity, reliability, and resilience remain key barriers to trust as organizations operationalize agentic AI at scale
Observability needs to shift from a supporting function to a foundational control layer for successful AI implementation
50% of Agentic AI projects are in production for limited uses or departments, while 23% have achieved mature enterprise-wide integration
Autonomous operations are expanding beyond IT operations - 72% use agents for IT operations and DevOps, but customer-facing applications are the fastest-growing segment
Human oversight remains critical - 69% of agentic AI decisions are currently human-verified
Organizations are aiming for an even human-AI partnership rather than full autonomy
The report emphasizes building trust in autonomous operations from pilot to production
