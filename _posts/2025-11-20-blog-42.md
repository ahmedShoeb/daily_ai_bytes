## Key Points

Google DeepMind and Google Research have launched WeatherNext 2, a highly advanced and efficient AI weather forecasting model.
WeatherNext 2 can generate forecasts 8x faster with up to 1-hour resolution, significantly improving upon previous models.
It can predict hundreds of possible weather scenarios from a single input in less than a minute on a single TPU, a task that would take hours with physics-based models.
The model leverages a new AI approach called a Functional Generative Network (FGN) to create physically realistic and interconnected forecasts.
WeatherNext 2 excels at forecasting complex 'joints' (interconnected weather systems) by learning from individual 'marginals' (standalone weather elements).
The forecast data from WeatherNext 2 is now accessible in Earth Engine and BigQuery, with an early access program on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform.
This advanced technology is already integrated into Google Search, Gemini, Pixel Weather, and Google Maps Platform’s Weather API, and will soon power weather information in Google Maps.
Google aims to continuously improve WeatherNext 2 by integrating new data sources and expanding its global accessibility to accelerate scientific discovery and decision-making.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, and welcome back to the podcast! Today, we've got some really exciting news from Google DeepMind and Google Research. They've just unveiled something called WeatherNext 2, and it's their most advanced and efficient AI weather forecasting model yet. Imagine getting incredibly detailed weather predictions that are not just fast, but also super accurate – that's what we're talking about! WeatherNext 2 can whip up forecasts eight times faster than before, and with an amazing resolution down to the hour. What's truly groundbreaking is its ability to predict hundreds of different possible weather scenarios from a single starting point. This means meteorologists can plan for a wider range of outcomes, especially those critical worst-case scenarios, all in under a minute on a single TPU, a feat that would take hours on traditional supercomputers. This isn't just a minor upgrade; WeatherNext 2 actually outperforms their previous state-of-the-art model on almost every variable and lead time. The magic behind this improvement lies in a new AI modeling approach called a Functional Generative Network, or FGN, which keeps the forecasts physically realistic even when exploring various possibilities. This FGN is brilliant at forecasting complex, interconnected weather systems, which they call 'joints,' by learning from individual weather elements, or 'marginals.' This is super important for understanding things like large regions affected by heat or the expected power output from a wind farm. And here's the best part: this isn't just lab research anymore. WeatherNext 2's data is already available in Earth Engine and BigQuery, and there's even an early access program on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. You might have already experienced its power because it's now upgrading weather forecasts in Google Search, Gemini, Pixel Weather, and Google Maps Platform’s Weather API, with Google Maps integration coming very soon. Google is clearly committed to pushing the boundaries of this technology, integrating even more data, and making these powerful tools accessible globally. This is a huge leap forward in helping us all make better decisions, from daily commutes to managing global supply chains, all thanks to next-generation AI weather forecasting!
