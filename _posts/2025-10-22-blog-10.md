## Key Points

- Approximately 10% of humanity uses AI weekly, primarily free tools for information-seeking.
- For advanced use, choose between paid models like Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT, costing $20-$200/month.
- Users should select specific AI models (e.g., 'agent' models for complex tasks) and thinking modes, rather than defaulting to 'auto' settings, for better results.
- Enhance AI answers by enabling 'Deep Research' mode for extensive web searches and connecting AI to personal data (e.g., email, calendar).
- Leverage multimodal inputs such as voice, images, video, and real-time screen/camera sharing for dynamic interaction.
- AI can generate high-quality documents (PowerPoints, Excel), code, images, and sophisticated videos (Sora 2, Veo 3.1), but be wary of the diminishing trustworthiness of online video content.
- Key tips include being aware of hallucinations (though less frequent), mitigating sycophancy by asking for critical feedback, providing ample context to the AI, and experimenting to learn its capabilities and limits.
- Building intuition about AI's capabilities and limitations is more important than becoming an expert, as the technology continues to evolve rapidly.

## Key Topics Discussed

Welcome to our podcast! Today, we're diving into an incredibly useful 'Opinionated Guide to Using AI,' which highlights that a significant 10% of the world now uses AI weekly, mostly through free tools. This guide offers practical advice based on real usage patterns, moving beyond mere hunches.

The article helps us navigate the choice between free and advanced AI models. While free options are great for basic tasks like seeking information, serious users looking for advanced features will likely need to invest in paid subscriptions, typically ranging from $20 to $200 a month. The top contenders for advanced use are Anthropic's Claude, Google’s Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, with others like Grok and various open-weights models also available. The key takeaway here is to pick a model that aligns with your specific needs, considering factors like web search capabilities, image creation, and privacy policies.

Moving beyond just picking a system, the guide emphasizes the importance of selecting the right AI model *within* a system. For complex tasks, it recommends 'agent' models over 'chat' models, as they can autonomously perform multiple steps and are more reliable. For paid users, it's crucial to manually select specific, more powerful models and 'thinking' modes (like GPT-5 Thinking Extended for ChatGPT) rather than relying on the default 'auto' settings, which often use less powerful models.

To get the best answers, the guide suggests two powerful techniques: utilizing 'Deep Research' mode, where the AI conducts extensive web searches over 10-15 minutes to produce high-quality, often cited reports; and connecting the AI to your personal data, allowing it to integrate information from your emails, calendars, and drives for tailored briefings. Imagine asking your AI for a detailed briefing of your day, with all your connected accounts! This is where AI truly shines.

The article also enthusiastically covers multimodal inputs. Forget old assistants like Siri; modern AI allows you to interact via voice, upload PDFs, images, and even video. A standout feature is the ability to share your screen or camera, letting the AI see what you see in real-time and respond, whether you're troubleshooting an appliance or translating a foreign sign. It's incredibly intuitive and powerful.

Furthermore, AI is rapidly advancing in content creation, capable of generating high-quality PowerPoints, Excel files, code, images, and now incredibly realistic videos. With tools like Sora 2 and Veo 3.1, AIs can create diverse video content with sound. However, this also comes with a significant warning: be highly skeptical of anything you see online, as AI-generated video is becoming indistinguishable from reality.

Finally, the guide offers some quick, but crucial, tips. While AI hallucinations are less frequent now, they still occur, so always double-check important information. Be aware of 'sycophancy,' where the AI might just agree with you; explicitly tell it to act as a critic for genuine feedback. Always provide the AI with sufficient context, as its memory is typically limited to the current chat. Don't overthink your prompts; modern AIs are smart enough to understand what you want. Most importantly, experiment and have fun! Play is a great way to discover the limits and capabilities of these systems.

The guide concludes by emphasizing that the goal isn't to become an AI expert, but to build an intuition about what these systems can and can't do. This intuition, it argues, will be the most valuable asset as AI continues its rapid evolution. So, pick a system, start with something meaningful to you, and don't be afraid to try something ridiculous just for the sheer fun of it!
