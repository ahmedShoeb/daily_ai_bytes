## Key Points

Anthropic's AWS spending significantly outpaces its revenue, with $2.66 billion spent through September 2025 against an estimated $2.55 billion in revenue.
In 2024, Anthropic spent $1.35 billion on AWS, exceeding 200% of its estimated $400-$600 million revenue.
AI coding company Cursor, Anthropic's largest customer, experienced a 104% increase in AWS costs in June 2025, from $6.2 million to $12.6 million.
This cost explosion for Cursor is attributed to Anthropic's introduction of "Priority Service Tiers," an aggressive rent-seeking measure.
The article argues that Anthropic's costs increase linearly with revenue, making its current business model unsustainable and raising doubts about its path to profitability.
The author suggests that the "Subprime AI Crisis," where model providers raise prices on previously subsidized rates, is real and threatens AI startups building on these models, especially when model providers launch competing products.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey podcast listeners, today we're diving deep into some eye-opening revelations about the true costs of running generative AI services, specifically focusing on Anthropic and its largest customer, Cursor. What we're seeing here really puts a spotlight on the financial pressures within the AI industry.

According to new information, Anthropic's spending on Amazon Web Services is far higher than previously understood. Through September 2025 alone, Anthropic has shelled out an astonishing $2.66 billion on AWS, actually exceeding its estimated revenue of $2.55 billion for the same period. And it gets wilder: in 2024, Anthropic's AWS bill hit $1.35 billion, which was over 200% of its estimated revenue of $400-$600 million. This suggests that their actual compute costs, especially when you factor in Google Cloud where they also have significant spend, are astronomically high.

Now, let's talk about Cursor, an AI coding company that happens to be Anthropic's biggest client. They saw their AWS bills more than double in a single month, jumping from $6.2 million in May 2025 to $12.6 million in June 2025. This massive increase is linked directly to Anthropic's introduction of "Priority Service Tiers," which the author describes as an aggressive move to extract more revenue. This tactic has been dubbed the "Subprime AI Crisis," where model providers, after initially offering subsidized rates, drastically increase prices, forcing their customers to shoulder exploding costs. It's particularly impactful for companies like Cursor that rely heavily on caching, which these new tiers penalize.

The article really hammers home that Anthropic's costs seem to rise almost linearly with its revenue. This indicates a deeply unsustainable business model, where making more money actually leads to burning more money at an alarming rate. The author speculates that Anthropic's increasing desperation for capital, as evidenced by its willingness to secure large investments from various sources, points to the immense and possibly uncontrollable expenses involved.

This situation isn't just about Anthropic; it's a stark warning for any AI startup building on top of foundational models from companies like OpenAI or Anthropic. The author fears that these model providers can not only raise prices aggressively but also launch directly competitive products, as Anthropic did with Claude Code, right after increasing costs on a client like Cursor.

Ultimately, the takeaway here is a pretty grim one for the AI ecosystem. The current economics of large language models appear to be fundamentally unprofitable. Unless there are drastic and unlikely price increases of 100% or more, these companies face an uphill battle to achieve sustainability. It paints a picture of a market where even success in attracting users can lead to a company bleeding out from escalating operational costs. It's truly a no-win scenario for many, with the customers of these AI startups ultimately bearing the brunt.
