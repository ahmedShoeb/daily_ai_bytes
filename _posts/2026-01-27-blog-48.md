## Key Points

The project is an AI-powered fitness trainer that uses Computer Vision and Pose Estimation to track and count exercise repetitions.
It features 'Auto Classify Mode' which uses a BiLSTM machine learning model to automatically identify the exercise being performed.
The system utilizes MediaPipe to extract body landmarks and calculate joint angles for accurate movement tracking.
It offers multiple modes including real-time Webcam tracking, Video Analysis for uploaded files, and a Chatbot assistant.
The classification model was trained on a mix of real-world datasets and synthetic data from the InfiniteRep dataset.
Built on the Streamlit framework, making it accessible through a user-friendly web interface.
The included fitness chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and LangChain to provide conversational exercise advice.
The project is based on a research paper titled 'Real-Time Fitness Exercise Classification and Counting from Video Frames.'

## Key Topics Discussed

If you've ever struggled to keep track of your reps while working out, you're going to love this! We’re looking at a fantastic open-source project by Riccardo Riccio called the Fitness AI Trainer. It’s an AI-powered web application that uses your webcam or uploaded videos to automatically recognize what exercise you’re doing and count your repetitions in real-time. Built with Streamlit, the app leverages advanced computer vision and pose estimation via MediaPipe to track your body landmarks. 

What makes this project really stand out is its 'Auto Classify Mode.' Using a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model, the system doesn't just look at a static image; it analyzes sequences of frames to understand movement patterns. It focuses on joint angles and normalized distances, making it robust against different body types and camera angles. Beyond just counting, the app includes a 'Fitness Coach' chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5, ready to answer your training questions. Whether you're doing bicep curls or shoulder presses, this tool acts like a digital personal trainer right in your browser, helping you stay focused on your form while it handles the math!
