## Key Points

Cloudflare is launching a private beta of AI Index for domains, a new web index for AI discoverability and fair compensation.
AI Index automatically creates an AI-optimized search index for websites, providing APIs like MCP server, LLMs.txt, and a search API.
Site owners will control their index, how it's used, and can monetize access via Pay per crawl and x402 integrations.
AI builders can subscribe to specific sites for structured updates and pay for access, moving away from indiscriminate crawling.
Cloudflare will also build an aggregated Open Index from participating sites for broader search and discovery, with monetization flowing back to individual sites.
The initiative aims to create a fairer ecosystem for content discovery and usage, addressing challenges like inefficient content signaling and costly crawling for AI builders.
AI Index will automatically process new/updated pages in real-time and manage all underlying technology.
Site owners have control over content inclusion/exclusion and access permissions through AI Crawl Control.
AI builders can discover, evaluate content with metadata, pay for access, and subscribe to real-time updates from opted-in websites.
The Open Index offers unified access across many participating sites, topic-specific bundles, and ensures bottom-up monetization.

## Key Topics Discussed

Cloudflare is introducing the private beta of its AI Index, a novel web indexing system designed to bridge the gap between content creators and AI builders, promoting discoverability and fair compensation. For domain owners, the AI Index automatically generates an AI-optimized search index for their website, offering a suite of standard APIs including an MCP server, LLMs.txt, and a search API. This empowers content creators with ownership and control over their data's visibility to AI, enabling them to monetize access through features like Pay per crawl and x402 integrations. This system allows creators to build modern search experiences on their own sites and ensures their content is discoverable by external AI and agentic providers while being fairly compensated.
For AI builders, the AI Index provides a more efficient and controlled method for discovering and retrieving web content. Instead of resource-intensive, indiscriminate crawling, builders can subscribe directly to opted-in websites, receiving structured, real-time updates as content changes, and compensating site owners fairly for each access. Cloudflare will also aggregate these individual indexes into an "Open Index," offering a unified platform for builders to search across collections or the broader web, while still ensuring individual sites retain control and earn from their participation.
The core motivation behind the AI Index is to foster a healthier ecosystem for content discovery and usage. It addresses current challenges where AI platforms largely control content crawling and indexing, and where content creators lack efficient ways to signal new content. Simultaneously, AI builders face high costs and inefficiencies when crawling unstructured data. The AI Index streamlines this process: when a domain enables the feature, Cloudflare automatically manages the AI-optimized index, processing updates in real-time. Site owners maintain granular control over what content is indexed and who can access it via AI Crawl Control, with the option to opt out entirely.
The platform provides several ready-to-use APIs for content creators, including an MCP Server for agentic applications, a flexible search API, LLMs.txt files for AI model understanding, a bulk data API for efficient content transfer, and pub-sub subscriptions for real-time updates. AI builders benefit from discovering and subscribing to high-quality, permissioned web data, evaluating content with metadata, paying fairly for access, and receiving real-time updates, leading to reduced costs and access to cleaner data. The aggregated Open Index further simplifies large-scale operations by offering unified access, broader discovery scopes (e.g., topic-specific bundles), and ensuring bottom-up monetization flows back to individual sites. Ultimately, Cloudflare's AI Index aims to empower websites to dictate content access and provide AI builders with structured, reliable data, fostering a more equitable and sustainable internet for AI content discovery.
