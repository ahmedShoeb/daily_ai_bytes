## Key Points

OpenAI is now allowing current and former employees to donate their equity to charity after years of frustration.
The company had promised this opportunity 18 months ago, using it as a recruiting tool.
The deadline for participation is short, making it difficult for some employees to engage.
This decision comes after increased employee concern over OpenAI's control of their equity and soaring valuation.
Past donation rounds occurred in 2021 and 2022, with a promised round after an early 2024 tender offer put on hold.
OpenAI has finalized its restructuring and its share price has significantly increased to about $483 per unit.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, big news from the world of AI! It seems OpenAI is finally caving to pressure and is now allowing its current and former employees to donate their company equity to charity. This has been a long time coming, with employees expressing growing frustration over the years about not being able to do this. Apparently, OpenAI even used the promise of charitable equity donations as a way to attract top talent, especially with the intense competition for AI professionals.

However, there's a bit of a catch. The company has given a really tight deadline for employees to decide on their donation amounts, which is much shorter than typical liquidation periods. This quick turnaround is making it tough for some to participate, especially since OpenAI is strongly recommending they consult with tax or financial advisors.

This whole situation has been brewing for a while, with employees feeling increasingly concerned about OpenAI's control over their equity, especially as the company's valuation has absolutely skyrocketed and its corporate structure has shifted. We've seen similar donation rounds in 2021 and 2022, but the latest one was put on indefinite hold after an early 2024 tender offer.

Now, with OpenAI having finalized its major funding round and completing its for-profit restructuring, it looks like they're finally loosening up those restrictions. It's also worth noting that OpenAI's share price has seen a significant jump, now valued at about $483 per unit, up from around $430 just last month. This move to allow charitable donations comes amidst a lot of internal changes and a soaring valuation, giving employees a long-awaited chance to give back with their substantial equity holdings.
