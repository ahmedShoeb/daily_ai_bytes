## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, exciting news from Google! They're opening applications for the second round of their Google.org Generative AI Accelerator. This program is all about getting powerful AI tools into the hands of organizations working to solve some of the world’s biggest challenges. A recent Google survey showed that lots of nonprofits *want* to use generative AI – like, 80% think it could help their work – but nearly half are running into roadblocks like a lack of training, the right tools, or funding. That's where this accelerator comes in! 

Last year, they supported 21 organizations to build gen AI-powered solutions, and collectively, they're aiming to impact over 30 million people by 2028. We’re talking about some really cool projects, like Tabiya, which is using AI to help career counselors reach *twice* as many job seekers, especially in developing countries. And Materiom, who is accelerating the development of sustainable plastic alternatives using Google’s Gemini model. The International Rescue Committee is also using Gemini to provide critical information to displaced people in over 25 languages!

So, if you’re with a nonprofit, a social enterprise, an academic institution, or even a civic organization and you’re looking to boost your social impact with AI, you’ll want to check this out. The accelerator offers six months of training, Google Cloud credits, and help from Google employees. Plus, there's $30 million in funding available. You can apply at g.co/Accelerator/GenAI, but the deadline is February 10th, 2025, so don’t wait! It’s a fantastic opportunity to make a real difference using the latest in AI technology.
