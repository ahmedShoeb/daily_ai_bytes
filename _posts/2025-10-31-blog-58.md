## Key Topics Discussed

Alright, tech enthusiasts, let's dive into some fascinating insights from the semiconductor and AI world! This article gives us a comprehensive look at what's shaping the industry right now, from memory giants to global competition.

First up, SK Hynix is making big moves in the High-Bandwidth Memory, or HBM, market. They've just locked down their 2026 HBM supply contracts, and it's clear that demand, especially from the booming AI sector, is going to outpace supply all the way through 2027. They're even pushing the boundaries with higher HBM4 specifications, recognizing that memory performance is becoming a critical bottleneck for AI chip developers. This isn't just any boom; it's a "super-boom" driven by a fundamental paradigm shift towards AI, suggesting a prolonged period of high demand and structurally constrained DRAM supply. And it's not just HBM; demand for eSSDs is also soaring thanks to AI investments, the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the need to offload GPU KV cache for more efficient AI operations. SK Hynix is even changing its business model to a pre-order and post-sales approach for memory, aiming for greater predictability and stability through long-term contracts. To keep up with all this, they're planning a significant increase in their 2026 capital expenditure to expand HBM supply and accelerate the migration to advanced process nodes across their memory products.

Now, let's zoom out to the broader semiconductor market. Analysts at Citi are forecasting global semiconductor sales to hit a whopping $731 billion in 2025, a 16% increase. What's driving this? Primarily, it's the surging prices of logic chips, especially those crucial AI accelerators. This indicates low inventory levels and plenty of room for further growth, with NVIDIA's data center expansion being a major catalyst.
