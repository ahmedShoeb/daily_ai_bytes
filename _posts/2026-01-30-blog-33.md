## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, exciting news in the AI space! Avataar, a company backed by Peak XV and Tiger Global, just released a new tool called Velocity. What does Velocity do? Well, it creates product videos *automatically* just from a product link. Think about that – no more expensive video shoots for every single item in a catalog! 

The idea behind this is simple. Video is king when it comes to online engagement and boosting sales, but creating those videos can be really costly and time-consuming. Avataar's Velocity aims to drastically lower those costs, making it possible for businesses to have videos for *all* their products, not just the big sellers. They’re facing competition from giants like Amazon and Google who are also exploring AI video creation. 

Avataar isn't new to this game. They've been around since 2015 and have raised over $55 million, initially focusing on interactive experiences and 3D models for e-commerce. They’ve learned a ton about what makes products visually appealing and how to showcase them effectively. And that’s where they stand out! Because they've built up this huge database of product information through 3D rendering, their AI can really understand what a product *is* and highlight its key features. They claim their models are smart enough to show the different attributes of, say, a hammer versus a smartphone. 

They've also focused heavily on accuracy and brand safety, building in checks to make sure the videos don't contain misleading information or anything that could damage a brand's reputation. Several big names are already giving it a try – HP, Victoria’s Secret, Lowe’s, and more. Plus, they offer an API so other companies can easily integrate this video creation into their own platforms. It's a really interesting development, and could change how we see product marketing online.
