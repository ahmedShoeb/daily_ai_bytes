## Key Points

Over 95% of international data and voice traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables.
Demand for subsea cables is increasing significantly as tech giants race to develop computation-intensive AI models and connect their growing networks of data centers.
Investment in new subsea cable projects is expected to almost double between 2025-2027, reaching around $13 billion.
Major tech companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are heavily investing in and even solely owning vast subsea cable networks, recognizing their critical role for AI and cloud services.
Cable disruptions, whether accidental (fishing, anchors) or from suspected sabotage, can sever internet access for entire countries and impact major cloud services.
Experts report a significant uptick in suspected intentional damages to subsea cables, particularly in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan, often linked to geopolitical tensions.
Governments and organizations like NATO are responding to these threats with operations like 'Baltic Sentry' to safeguard subsea infrastructure.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is implementing tighter rules, restricting connections to 'foreign adversary nations' and prohibiting the use of hardware from companies like Huawei due to security concerns.
Tech companies such as Meta and Amazon have stated they do not work with Chinese cable providers on their announced systems, complying with U.S. policy.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! Today, we're diving deep, literally, into the world of underwater communication cables – the unsung heroes carrying over 95% of our international data and voice traffic. From telegraphs in 1850 to modern fiber optics, these cables are the backbone of our connected world. Now, with the explosive growth of AI and the ever-expanding networks of data centers from tech giants, the demand for subsea cables is skyrocketing. We're talking about a projected $13 billion investment between 2025 and 2027, nearly doubling previous periods! Meta, for example, is building Project Waterworth, a colossal 50,000 km cable connecting five continents, which they'll solely own. Amazon has its own Fastnet project, linking the U.S. to Ireland, promising mind-boggling capacity. Google and Microsoft are also major players, investing in numerous cables globally, all because, as Meta's Alex Aime puts it, without this connectivity, data centers are just 'really expensive warehouses.'

But it's not all smooth sailing. These critical arteries are vulnerable. We've seen entire nations, like Tonga in 2022, cut off due to volcanic eruptions damaging their only cable. Even major services like Microsoft Azure have faced disruptions from cable cuts in the Red Sea. While most damage is accidental, due to fishing or anchors, there's a growing concern about intentional sabotage. Experts like Matthew Mooney from Recorded Future have noted a significant uptick in suspicious incidents, especially in tense regions like the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan, coinciding with geopolitical tensions. Governments are taking this seriously. NATO launched 'Baltic Sentry' to protect infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, and the U.S. FCC is implementing stricter rules, prohibiting connections to 'foreign adversary nations' and banning 'spy gear' from companies like Huawei in U.S.-linked cables, citing concerns about China and Russia. Big Tech companies like Meta and Amazon are confirming their compliance, emphasizing they don't work with Chinese providers on their announced projects. It's clear that protecting these underwater lifelines is paramount to our global connectivity, national security, and the future of AI.
