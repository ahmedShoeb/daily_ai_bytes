## Key Topics Discussed

Alright, podcast listeners, big news in the tech world! Reddit has officially filed a lawsuit against the AI answer engine Perplexity, along with three data-scraping service providers: SerpApi, Oxylabs, and AWMProxy. Reddit's main beef is that these companies are allegedly engaging in 'industrial-scale, unlawful circumvention of data protections' to get their hands on valuable, copyrighted content from Reddit. They're basically saying Perplexity is trying to fuel its AI engine with stolen data, rather than striking a proper deal with Reddit, something other big players like OpenAI and Google have done.

The drama escalated after Reddit sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity in May 2024. Surprisingly, instead of slowing down, the volume of Reddit citations on Perplexity actually went up! Reddit even set a trap with a post designed to be crawled only by Google, and within hours, Perplexity reportedly reproduced its contents, leading Reddit to believe Perplexity is scraping Google search results for their data.

Ben Lee, Reddit’s chief legal officer, slammed this as an 'industrial-scale ‘data laundering’ economy,' where scrapers bypass protections to steal data for AI training. He specifically called out Oxylabs, AWM Proxy, and SerpAI for allegedly using shady tactics to steal Reddit content from Google Search.

Now, Perplexity isn't taking this lying down. Their head of communication, Jesse Dwyer, stated they'll 'always fight vigorously for users’ rights to freely and fairly access public knowledge' and that their approach is 'principled and responsible.' They later added that as an application-layer company, they don't train AI models on content, so signing a licensing agreement for that purpose is impossible for them. Oxylabs also weighed in, expressing shock and disappointment, claiming Reddit made no attempt to speak with them directly. They argue no company should claim ownership of public data and suggest Reddit might just be trying to sell public data at an 'inflated price.' This lawsuit really highlights the ongoing tension between content creators and AI companies over data usage.
