## Key Points

The Google Maps tool is now available in the Gemini API, allowing developers to integrate Maps data into their applications.
This integration connects Gemini's reasoning capabilities with data from over 250 million places, enabling new geospatial-aware AI products.
Developers can use this tool to improve experiences in travel, real estate, retail, and logistics by providing detailed itinerary planning, hyper-local recommendations, and place-based answers.
The tool can be combined with Grounding with Google Search for even more powerful and contextually aware applications, leveraging both structured Maps data and descriptive web context.
Grounding with Google Maps is generally available now, supported by the latest Gemini models.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey podcast listeners! Today we're diving into a super cool update from Google: the Google Maps tool is officially available in the Gemini API. This is a game-changer for developers, as it allows them to 'ground' their AI applications using a massive dataset from Google Maps, which includes information from over 250 million places! Think about it – you can now combine Gemini's powerful reasoning with real-world geographic data, opening up a whole new world of smart, location-aware AI products. 

Just like how 'Grounding with Google Search' provides up-to-date web information, this new Maps grounding tool delivers rich, current geospatial data for any query where location is key. Developers can now build incredible, intuitive experiences across various sectors. Imagine a travel app that doesn't just list places but creates a full-day itinerary, complete with distances, travel times, and local details like up-to-date business hours. Or a real estate app that helps families find kid-friendly neighborhoods by identifying nearby playgrounds and schools. You can even get precise answers to hyper-local questions, like whether a specific cafe has outdoor seating, all powered by Maps data, including user reviews.

And for the ultimate in contextual awareness, you can combine Grounding with Google Maps and Grounding with Google Search in the same request! Maps provides that structured, factual data – addresses, hours, ratings – while Search offers descriptive, timely context like event schedules and news. For example, if you ask about 'live music on Beale Street,' the model can use Maps for venue hours and Search for specific showtimes. Google's internal evaluations show that using both tools together significantly improves response quality. This new tool is generally available now, supported by Google's latest models, giving developers the flexibility to choose the right balance of performance and cost. So, if you're a developer, it's time to start building!
