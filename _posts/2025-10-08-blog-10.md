Stargate
 data centers to realize CEO Sam Altman's compute ambitions.
- OpenAI is reviewing proposals from approximately 800 applicants, with about 20 sites in advanced diligence across the U.S. for its AI supercomputing hubs.
- Key factors for site selection include access to power, scalability, and community buy-in, with tax incentives playing a smaller role.
- OpenAI plans a 17-gigawatt data center buildout in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank.
- New data center sites will incorporate diverse energy sources, including battery-backed solar, gas turbine refurbishments, and potentially small modular nuclear reactors.
- Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion to fuel OpenAI's expansion, which involves purchasing millions of Nvidia's GPUs.
- OpenAI views owning its physical infrastructure as a strategic pillar, on par with product and model development, to control the future of AI.
- Competition for large-scale data center sites is intense, with companies like Meta, Amazon, and Anthropic also making significant investments.
- OpenAI has a self-built solar campus already operational in Abilene, Texas, demonstrating a differentiated approach to infrastructure.
- Despite the immense challenges, OpenAI is committed to scaling from single-gigawatt projects to massive campuses to achieve its vision for AI.
