## Key Points

Shield AI is set to unveil its autonomous fighter jet, the X-Bat, valued at $5.3 billion.
The X-Bat is an unmanned aircraft with a jet engine, a 2,000-mile range, 50,000-foot altitude capability, and vertical takeoff/landing for remote operations without a runway.
It is piloted by Shield AI's Hivemind AI software, which the company considers a cornerstone and future growth driver.
The X-Bat is designed for combat, can be equipped with missiles, and is projected to cost around $27 million, significantly less than advanced military aircraft like the F-35.
Shield AI aims to save service members' lives by reducing human risk in combat.
The company has secured major defense contracts, including a nearly $200 million contract with the U.S. Coast Guard for its V-Bat drone.
Despite rapid growth, Shield AI is smaller than defense primes and competitors, and faced a setback with a drone landing incident in 2023 affecting customer confidence.
The increasing prevalence and strategic importance of drones in modern warfare, as seen in conflicts like Ukraine, highlight the demand for these systems.
The U.S. government is actively promoting drone technology development and integration through initiatives like the 'Unleashing American Drone Dominance' executive order and significant funding.
Shield AI aims to empower the defense industrial base with its AI autonomy development tools and infrastructure.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright podcast listeners, we've got some cutting-edge news today! Shield AI, a company that's making some serious waves in the defense industry, is about to unveil its next-generation autonomous fighter jet, the X-Bat. This company, already valued at a whopping $5.3 billion, is really pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

So, what's so special about the X-Bat? Well, it's an unmanned aircraft with a powerful jet engine, boasting an impressive 2,000-mile range and the ability to soar up to 50,000 feet. But here's the kicker: it can take off and land vertically, meaning it doesn't need a runway and can operate in super remote locations, even from a ship in the middle of the ocean! This incredible machine is piloted by Shield AI's very own AI software, called Hivemind, which they see as the core of their future growth.

Now, this isn't just another drone. The X-Bat is designed for combat and can be equipped with missiles. And get this, Shield AI expects to produce it for around $27 million, which is a fraction of the cost of current advanced military aircraft like the F-35, which costs over $100 million! The company's mission here is to fundamentally save lives by reducing the risk to service members in dangerous situations.

Shield AI, founded in 2015, has already landed some significant defense contracts, including a nearly $200 million deal with the U.S. Coast Guard for another one of their drones, the V-Bat. However, it's a competitive field, and while they're growing fast, they're still relatively small compared to industry giants. They even had a hiccup in 2023 with a drone landing incident that affected customer confidence, but they're confident they've rebuilt momentum.

The increasing use of drones in conflicts around the world, like in Ukraine, really underscores the critical importance of these systems. And the U.S. government is definitely on board, with initiatives like the 'Unleashing American Drone Dominance' executive order and billions allocated in funding, aiming to accelerate drone technology. Shield AI is looking to empower the entire defense industrial base with their AI autonomy tools, working with major contractors to meet the needs of the warfighter and our allies. This is definitely a company to keep an eye on!
