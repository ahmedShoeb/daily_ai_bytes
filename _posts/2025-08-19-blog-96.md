## Key Topics Discussed

Amazon is expanding same-day delivery of fresh foods to over 1,000 US cities and plans to reach 2,300 locations by the end of the year. This move aims to encourage customers to include fresh items in their online orders. The service is free for Prime members on orders exceeding $25, with a $2.99 fee for smaller orders; non-members pay $12.99.
