## Key Points

OpenAI appears to be preparing a new subscription tier called ChatGPT Pro Lite priced at $100 per month
The discovery was made by Tibor Blaho, a Vienna-based engineer known for uncovering unreleased ChatGPT features
The new $100 plan would fill the gap between Plus at $20/month and Pro at $200/month
This tier could serve freelancers, researchers, and developers who need more than Plus but not unlimited Pro access
The timing coincides with OpenAI's recent hiring of Peter Steinberger, creator of the OpenClaw agent framework
Sam Altman has indicated the future will be 'extremely multi-agent' suggesting compute-heavy features
The $100 tier could serve as entry point for always-on agentic capabilities with higher compute costs
No release date has been confirmed and exact feature set remains unclear
The move could put competitive pressure on Google which doesn't offer an equivalent mid-tier plan
OpenAI currently offers Free, Go, Plus, Pro, Team, Business, and Enterprise plans
