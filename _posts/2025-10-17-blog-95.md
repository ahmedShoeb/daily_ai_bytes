## Key Points

- Agentic AI envisions LLMs as intelligent personal assistants interacting with rich external resources, acting on behalf of users.
- Unlike standalone generative AI, agentic AI systems can perform complex tasks like arranging travel plans by understanding user preferences and making intelligent decisions.
- The 
native language
 of agentic AI is embedding spaces, which are internal, abstract representations of content that allow for efficient inter-agent communication.
- The concept of an 
agentic Web
 is introduced, where websites are pre-translated into embeddings for more efficient AI navigation.
- Significant challenges include managing context sharing between agents to ensure functionality while mitigating privacy concerns due to the lossy nature of embeddings.
- Agentic AI will engage in formal negotiations and bargaining, with research drawing insights from game theory and behavioral economics, as LLMs have shown human-like behaviors in such settings.
- A major scientific challenge is imbuing agentic AI with 
subjective common sense
, which involves understanding individual, nuanced preferences and implicit policies.
- The era of agentic AI is rapidly advancing, building on generative AI, with early systems already demonstrating sophisticated capabilities in areas like coding.

## Key Topics Discussed

The article explores the burgeoning field of agentic AI, differentiating it from generative AI by positing LLMs as underlying engines for complex systems that interact with external resources and act autonomously on users' behalf. It illustrates this with the example of an agentic AI assistant managing travel plans, demonstrating its ability to learn preferences, schedule, book, and pay for itineraries intelligently. The author highlights that the progression from generative to agentic AI is a natural evolution, leading to a new kind of intelligent operating system. A key scientific frontier is the
