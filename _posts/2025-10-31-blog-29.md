## Key Points

GitHub is launching Agent HQ at Universe 2025 to create a unified workflow for orchestrating AI agents.
Agent HQ will integrate coding agents from major providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google directly into GitHub's platform.
These agents will be accessible through existing paid GitHub Copilot subscriptions.
New features include a 'Mission Control' for assigning, steering, and tracking agent work across GitHub, VS Code, mobile, and CLI.
VS Code will introduce 'Plan Mode' for project planning and allow creation of custom agents using AGENTS.md files.
GitHub is also rolling out 'GitHub Code Quality' for organization-wide visibility and governance of code maintainability and reliability.
A 'Copilot metrics dashboard' will provide usage metrics, and a 'control plane' will enable enterprise administrators to manage AI access and agent behavior.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, get ready for some big news from GitHub! At Universe 2025, they're launching something truly transformative called Agent HQ. This isn't just another AI tool; it's GitHub's vision for a unified, open ecosystem that brings together all your AI coding agents into one seamless workflow. Imagine having the power to orchestrate a fleet of specialized agents from companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI, all working together within the GitHub flow you already know and trust. These agents won't be external add-ons; they'll be native to GitHub and accessible through your paid GitHub Copilot subscription. 

GitHub is rolling out a suite of new capabilities to support this vision, starting with 'Mission Control.' This is your new command center, available across GitHub, VS Code, mobile, and the CLI, allowing you to direct, monitor, and manage every AI-driven task. In VS Code, they're introducing 'Plan Mode,' which works with Copilot to help you build step-by-step approaches for tasks by asking clarifying questions upfront. You'll also be able to create custom agents using AGENTS.md files, giving you granular control over their behavior. 

But it's not just about power; it's about confidence and control for your team. GitHub is tackling code quality head-on with 'GitHub Code Quality,' offering org-wide visibility and reporting to improve maintainability and reliability. Copilot's coding agents will even get an initial code review step built into their workflow! For organizations, a 'Copilot metrics dashboard' will provide insights into AI's impact, and a dedicated 'control plane' will empower enterprise administrators to govern AI access and agent behavior. GitHub built Agent HQ for developers, by developers, aiming to bring order and governance to the new era of AI-powered development, helping you build faster and with more confidence.
