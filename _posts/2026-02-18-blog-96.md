## Key Points

Microsoft is pursuing "true self-sufficiency" in AI by developing its own models to reduce reliance on OpenAI, marking a fundamental strategic shift
Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI chief and DeepMind co-founder, is leading the initiative to build cutting-edge foundational models with gigawatt-scale computing
The company is developing MAI internal models expected to be released in 2026, while maintaining Azure API access to OpenAI models through 2032
Microsoft has created the Maia 200 AI accelerator chip and is building the Fairwater network of data centers to support its new models
This shift follows an October 2025 restructuring of Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI that gave both companies more flexibility
Microsoft maintains a 27% stake in OpenAI valued at approximately $135 billion despite developing competing models
The company is diversifying AI partnerships by hosting models from Anthropic (Claude), Meta (Llama), and Mistral alongside its growing portfolio
Suleyman predicts many white-collar computer-based jobs could be fully automated within 12-18 months, with professional-grade AGI handling routine work in law, finance, and marketing
Microsoft's MAI-1-preview model was trained on 15,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, representing substantial capital investment
This dual-track approach gives Microsoft flexibility to develop its own capabilities while maintaining access to OpenAI's technology through 2032
