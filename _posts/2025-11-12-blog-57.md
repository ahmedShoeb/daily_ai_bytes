## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone, exciting news from OpenAI! They've just rolled out some fantastic updates to supercharge your Codex usage and API experience. First up, meet the GPT-5-Codex-Mini. This is a more compact and super cost-efficient version of GPT-5-Codex, giving you about four times more usage with just a slight tweak in capability. It's coming to the CLI and IDE extension, with API support right around the corner, and Codex will even smartly suggest you switch to it when you're nearing your rate limits. 

But that's not all! Thanks to some slick efficiency improvements on their GPUs, OpenAI is boosting rate limits. If you're a ChatGPT Plus, Business, or Edu user, get ready for a 50% increase in your rate limits. And for our Pro and Enterprise folks, you're getting priority processing for maximum speed. 

For our developers out there, webhooks are officially here for API events. Now you can get notifications for things like completed responses, fine-tuning jobs, and batch jobs, making those long-horizon tasks much more reliable. They've also introduced a new 'Prompt' object, which is a game-changer for managing, versioning, and optimizing your prompts across the Playground, API, Evals, and Stored Completions—no more manual copy-pasting! 

And speaking of the Playground, it's gotten some love too! There's an 'Optimize' button to fine-tune your prompts for the API, and you can now save, reuse, and share your configured Prompts. Lastly, the Evals feature now supports tools and Structured Outputs, letting you evaluate tool calls based on arguments and responses. These updates are all about making your work with OpenAI even more powerful and seamless!
