## Key Points

ChatGPT apps should provide specific capabilities rather than porting an entire product, acting as a toolkit for the model.
Great apps add value in three ways: enabling the model to "Know" new context, "Do" real actions on the user's behalf, or "Show" information in a clearer UI.
Designing for conversational interaction is crucial, handling both vague and specific user intents, and introducing the app's value effectively without assuming prior brand awareness.
Developers must design for both the human user and the model runtime, ensuring clear, descriptive actions, privacy, and structured outputs.
Apps should be built to fit into an ecosystem, with small, focused actions and outputs that are easily integrated by other tools, rather than creating walled-garden experiences.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! Today, we're diving into what makes a truly great ChatGPT app. It's not about stuffing your entire product into ChatGPT, but rather, giving the model a focused toolkit with specific 'powers.' Think of your app as a specialized assistant that can perform tasks, trigger interactions, or access data when needed.

The article highlights three key ways these apps can genuinely add value. First, they can help ChatGPT 'Know' new things by providing live data, internal metrics, or specialized datasets it wouldn't otherwise see. Second, they let ChatGPT 'Do' real actions on a user's behalf, like creating records, sending messages, scheduling, or even controlling IoT devices. And third, they can 'Show' information in much better ways than plain text, using things like tables, charts, or visual summaries, especially when users are making choices.

Designing these apps requires a conversational mindset. You need to think about how they handle both vague and specific user requests, and how they introduce themselves effectively, especially to users who might not be familiar with your brand. It's also crucial to design for both the human user and the model itself, ensuring that your app's actions and parameters are clear, privacy is built-in, and outputs are structured and predictable.

Finally, the article really drives home the idea of designing for an ecosystem. Your app isn't an island; it's one tool among many. So, keep your actions small and focused, and make sure your outputs are easy for other apps, or even future versions of your own app, to build upon. This allows for a much more fluid and integrated user experience within ChatGPT. They even provide a handy checklist to make sure you're hitting all the right notes: new powers, focused surface, first interaction, model-friendliness, evaluation, and ecosystem fit. If you can tick most of those boxes, you're well on your way to building an indispensable ChatGPT app!
