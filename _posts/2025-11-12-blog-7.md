## Key Points

Nested Learning is a new ML paradigm introduced by Google Research to combat 'catastrophic forgetting' in continual learning.
The paradigm views machine learning models as a set of smaller, nested optimization problems, each with its own internal workflow.
It unifies the model's architecture and the optimization algorithm, treating them as different 'levels' of optimization.
Nested Learning allows for the design of learning components with deeper computational depth, which helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
The paper 'Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architectures' was published at NeurIPS 2025.
A proof-of-concept, self-modifying architecture called 'Hope' was developed using Nested Learning principles.
Hope demonstrates superior performance in language modeling and better long-context memory management than existing models.
The paradigm also leads to 'deep optimizers' and 'continuum memory systems' (CMS), which enhance memory effectiveness for continual learning.
Experiments confirm that Hope architecture achieves lower perplexity and higher accuracy compared to modern recurrent models and standard transformers.
Nested Learning aims to close the gap between limited LLM capabilities and the continual learning abilities of the human brain.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright podcast listeners, get ready for some exciting news from Google Research! They've just introduced a game-changing concept called 'Nested Learning,' a brand-new machine learning paradigm designed to tackle one of the biggest headaches in AI: 'catastrophic forgetting.' You know, when an AI learns something new but then completely forgets something it knew before? Nested Learning aims to stop that in its tracks.

Here's the cool part: instead of seeing an ML model as one big, continuous process, Nested Learning views it as a system of smaller, interconnected learning problems, all nested within each other. Each of these mini-problems has its own internal workflow and update rate. The folks at Google are basically saying that the model's architecture and how we train it – the optimization algorithm – aren't separate things; they're just different 'levels' of optimization. By understanding this, we can design AI with much deeper computational capabilities, which is key to avoiding that pesky catastrophic forgetting.

They even built a proof-of-concept, self-modifying architecture called 'Hope' to show off what Nested Learning can do. And get this, Hope is kicking butt! It's showing superior performance in language modeling and way better long-context memory management compared to existing state-of-the-art models. It can even take advantage of 'continuum memory systems,' which are like super-efficient memory modules that update at different frequencies, creating a much richer and more effective memory for continual learning.

Experiments have totally confirmed the power of Nested Learning, deep optimizers, and architectures like Hope. Whether it's language modeling, common-sense reasoning, or even tricky long-context tasks, Hope is consistently outperforming modern recurrent models and standard transformers, showing lower perplexity and higher accuracy. This paradigm is a huge step forward in bridging the gap between the limited memory of current large language models and the incredible, continuous learning abilities of the human brain. The research community is buzzing, and we can't wait to see how this new dimension helps build the next generation of self-improving AI!
