## Key Points

Periodic Labs launched with a substantial $300 million seed funding round, backed by notable investors including Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia, Accel, Elad Gil, Jeff Dean, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Bezos.
The company was co-founded by Ekin Dogus Cubuk, who led the materials and chemistry team at Google Brain and DeepMind, and Liam Fedus, a former VP of Research at OpenAI and a key figure in the creation of ChatGPT and the first trillion-parameter neural network.
Cubuk's previous work includes the AI tool GNoME, which discovered over 2 million new crystals.
Periodic Labs' ambitious goal is to automate scientific discovery by developing AI scientists that operate in autonomous laboratories, conducting physical experiments and iterating on findings.
The initial focus of Periodic Labs is to invent novel superconductors that are more efficient and require less energy, as well as discover other new materials.
The company also aims to collect vast amounts of physical world data generated by its AI scientists to further advance AI models, addressing the perceived exhaustion of internet-based data sources for scientific AI.
The startup is comprised of researchers experienced in major AI and materials science projects, including OpenAI's agent Operator and Microsoft's MatterGen.
While Periodic Labs represents a significant effort in this field, other organizations and startups are also pursuing AI-driven scientific discovery.

## Key Topics Discussed

Periodic Labs, a new venture founded by former researchers from OpenAI and DeepMind, has emerged from stealth with an impressive $300 million in seed funding. This substantial investment comes from a consortium of prominent tech industry backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia, Accel, Elad Gil, Jeff Dean, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Bezos. The company's co-founders are Ekin Dogus Cubuk, who previously led the materials and chemistry team at Google Brain and DeepMind, and Liam Fedus, a former VP of Research at OpenAI credited with contributions to ChatGPT and the development of the first trillion-parameter neural network. Cubuk's prior work notably includes the GNoME AI tool, which was responsible for the discovery of over 2 million new crystals. Periodic Labs' core mission is to revolutionize scientific discovery by automating the entire process. This involves creating 'AI scientists' that will operate within autonomous laboratories, where robots will conduct physical experiments, collect data, and continuously learn and refine their approaches. The initial focus for Periodic Labs is the invention of advanced superconductors, aiming for materials that offer superior performance and reduced energy consumption. Beyond superconductors, the company also intends to discover other novel materials. A crucial aspect of their strategy is to generate and collect extensive physical world data from their AI-driven experiments. The founders believe that current scientific AI models have reached a point where internet-based data sources are 'exhausted,' and new, real-world experimental data is essential for continued AI evolution. The team at Periodic Labs is composed of highly experienced researchers who have contributed to significant projects in AI and materials science, such as OpenAI's agent Operator and Microsoft's MatterGen. While Periodic Labs stands out due to its leadership and funding, it is part of a growing movement in the scientific community exploring the use of AI to automate chemistry and materials discovery, with other startups like Tetsuwan Scientific and academic institutions also active in this field.
