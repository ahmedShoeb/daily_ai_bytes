## Overview

Google is rolling out a new feature for its Gemini AI chatbot that will allow it to remember past conversations without prompting. The feature will be turned on by default, but can be disabled in settings. If turned on, Gemini automatically recalls key details and preferences and uses them to personalize its output.

## Key Points

- Gemini will automatically recall key details and preferences.
- Users can disable the feature in settings.
- Google will rename its “Gemini Apps Activity” setting to “Keep Activity”.
- A new “temporary chats” option in Gemini preserves privacy.

## Key Topics Discussed

Google is updating Gemini to remember past conversations without prompting, expanding on a previous update that required users to ask Gemini to remember preferences. The new feature, enabled by default, can be disabled in settings and personalizes output based on recalled details. Google is also renaming “Gemini Apps Activity” to “Keep Activity,” using a sample of file and photo uploads to improve services, with an option to disable. A “temporary chats” option ensures privacy by not saving conversations, preventing personalization, and limiting storage to 72 hours. Concerns about delusional chats, similar to those raised with ChatGPT's memory feature, are addressed by Google, who state they are continuously improving their safeguards and providing users with easy controls.
