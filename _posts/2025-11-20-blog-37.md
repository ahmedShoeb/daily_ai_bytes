## Key Points

- An AI agent was used to add a 'summarize' button to a dashboard.
- The 'summarize' button utilizes the OpenAI Responses API with the gpt-5.1 model to generate summaries.
- Dashboard metric summaries are displayed in a modal.
- New UI components for a dialog/modal were integrated into the dashboard.
- The site-header.tsx file was updated to include the summarization button and handle the modal logic.
- A new Next.js API route (`/api/summarize`) was created to interact with the OpenAI Responses API.
- The environment requires an `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set for the API route to function.
- Instructions are provided on how to run and use the new dashboard summarization feature.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright folks, we've got a fascinating one today straight from the OpenAI Cookbook! This article dives deep into how to build a coding agent using GPT-5.1 to implement a slick new summarization feature for a dashboard. Imagine this: you've got a dashboard full of metrics, and with a single click, an AI can give you the key insights. That's exactly what this guide walks us through.

The process involved several key steps, all executed by our coding agent. First up, a brand new Radix-based dialog component was introduced into `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`. This is the fancy modal that pops up to show you the summary. Next, the `src/components/site-header.tsx` file got an update. This is where our 'Summarize' button lives, and it's also responsible for managing the modal's state – think loading indicators, displaying the summary, or even showing error messages. When you click that button, it triggers an asynchronous call to a new API endpoint.

That API endpoint, `src/app/api/summarize/route.ts`, is where the real magic happens. It's set up using Next.js and, crucially, it taps into the OpenAI Responses API with the powerful `gpt-5.1` model. It sends specific instructions to the AI, asking for a concise summary of dashboard insights, focusing on trends, anomalies, and overall performance in just a few bullet points. The AI then returns that summary as a JSON response.

Of course, for all this to work, you'll need to set up your environment by ensuring your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is properly configured in a `.env.local` file. The article concludes by providing clear instructions on how to run the updated dashboard and start using your brand-new AI-powered summarization feature. It even hints at future possibilities, like sending actual dashboard data to the API for even more tailored summaries. Pretty neat, right?
