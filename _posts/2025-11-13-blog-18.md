## Key Topics Discussed

Hey podcast listeners! We've got some interesting news out of China today. The typically low-profile AI start-up DeepSeek recently made a rare public appearance at a state-backed industry event. A senior researcher, Chen Deli, spoke on behalf of their founder and CEO, Liang Wenfeng, and he had some pretty candid remarks. DeepSeek is apparently still fully committed to developing artificial general intelligence, or AGI, but Chen acknowledged the potentially 'dangerous' impacts it could have on society. He's optimistic about the technology itself, which is understandable given their field, but he's quite pessimistic about the overall societal consequences. He even went so far as to warn that most jobs could eventually be automated, suggesting we're currently in a 'honeymoon phase' with AI before its full job-displacing potential is realized. This is a significant moment for DeepSeek, as it's one of the few times they've sent a representative to a public industry event, and their CEO hasn't been seen publicly since meeting with President Xi Jinping earlier this year. It definitely highlights the growing conversation around AI's future and its impact on the workforce.
