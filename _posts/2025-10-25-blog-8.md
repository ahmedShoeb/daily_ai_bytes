## Key Points

Snapchat's new "Imagine Lens," an open-prompt image-generation AI tool, is now available for free to all users.
Previously, the AI Lens was exclusive to paid subscribers like Lens+ and Snapchat Platinum.
Users can generate or edit Snaps using custom text prompts, for example, turning themselves into an alien or creating a 'grumpy cat' image.
The move comes as Snapchat faces competition from other AI video-generating apps from Meta (Meta AI) and OpenAI (Sora).
Free users will receive a limited number of image generations, varying by region and capacity.
The Imagine Lens is initially rolling out to U.S. users, with plans to expand to Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! Big news from Snapchat today. They're making their super cool 'Imagine Lens' available for free to all users in the U.S. now! This is their first open-prompt AI Lens for image generation, and it's a game-changer. Imagine being able to take a selfie and then, with a simple text prompt, turn yourself into an alien, or create an image of a 'grumpy cat' from scratch. You can use it to try out Halloween costumes or just reimagine your friends in a totally new look.

This Lens was actually launched back in September, but until now, it was only for those with a paid subscription, like Lens+ and Snapchat Platinum members. So, opening it up to everyone is a pretty significant move! Of course, free users will get a limited number of generations, which makes sense, but it's still a fantastic way to experiment with AI.

Snapchat is definitely feeling the heat from competitors like Meta AI and OpenAI's Sora, which are also rolling out some advanced AI video-generating features. So, making this AI image Lens free is a smart play to keep users engaged and competitive in the fast-evolving AI landscape. While it's starting in the U.S., they've got plans to bring it to Canada, Great Britain, and Australia soon, so keep an eye out for that! You can find the Lens right in the app's carousel or just search for it by name. Snapchat says its Lenses are accessed over 8 billion times a day, so it's clear people love to get creative!
