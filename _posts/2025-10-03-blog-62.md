## Key Points

Vibe coding is defined as using AI as a high-level programming language to build something.
A major challenge in vibe coding games is context management, as model performance degrades when context windows fill up.
"Shallot" is introduced as a lightweight context management system to address this issue.
Initial exploration of vibe coding games on Roblox, Unity, and the Web Stack revealed trade-offs in AI performance, abstraction, and context management.
VibeGame is presented as a solution: a high-level declarative game engine built on web technologies (three.js, rapier, bitecs) for AI-assisted game development.
VibeGame's design emphasizes high-level abstraction, a declarative XML-like syntax, and an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.
While effective for basic game mechanics, VibeGame currently struggles with more complex features not yet implemented in the engine.
Future development plans include fleshing out the engine with more built-in mechanics and improving AI guidance systems.

## Key Topics Discussed

The article "VibeGame: Exploring Vibe Coding Games" delves into the concept of "vibe coding" games, defining it as leveraging AI as a high-level programming language for game development. The author highlights a significant challenge in this approach: context management, where large project contexts can lead to degraded AI model performance. To mitigate this, a lightweight context management system called "Shallot" is introduced, utilizing simple commands to load and update context.

The article then details an initial exploration into vibe coding games across three platforms: Roblox MCP, Unity MCP, and the Web Stack. Roblox offered excellent abstraction but lacked context management and transparency. Unity, despite full file system access, proved too complex and inconsistent for AI without significant domain knowledge. The Web Stack (using three.js, rapier, and bitecs) demonstrated superior AI proficiency due to extensive training data but required building an engine from scratch due to its low-level nature.

Based on these findings, the author introduces VibeGame, a new high-level declarative game engine built upon the web stack. VibeGame's design philosophy focuses on high-level abstraction inspired by sandbox games, a declarative XML-like syntax easily understood by AI, and an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture for modularity. An example demonstrates how VibeGame simplifies scene creation with automatic player, camera, and lighting setup.

Testing revealed that VibeGame is effective for building games with core mechanics it supports, such as simple platformers or physics-based games. However, it currently struggles with more complex features like interaction, inventory, or multiplayer capabilities not yet built into the engine. The author concludes that while it doesn't support a "one-shot make me a game" approach, it works well when treated as a high-level programming language, requiring users to understand its capabilities. Future plans include expanding the engine's built-in mechanics and enhancing AI guidance systems.
