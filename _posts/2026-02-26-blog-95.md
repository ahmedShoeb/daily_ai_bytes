## Key Points

- ASML, the sole supplier of commercial EUV lithography machines, announced a breakthrough increasing EUV light source power from 600 watts to 1,000 watts
- The power boost will allow chip manufacturers like TSMC and Intel to expose silicon wafers more quickly, increasing chip production speed and reducing costs
- By 2030, the upgrade should enable customers to process around 330 wafers per hour, up from approximately 220 today
- Each wafer can yield anywhere from dozens to thousands of individual chips depending on the design
- EUV technology uses a complex process firing molten tin droplets 100,000 times per second, heated by lasers into plasma hotter than the sun's surface to create EUV light
- The breakthrough was achieved by doubling the number of tin droplets and using two shaping laser pulses instead of one
- ASML sees a clear path to reaching 1,500 watts and potentially 2,000 watts in the future
- EUV technology has become a geopolitical focal point with restrictions on sales to China and increased competition from American startups like Substrate and xLight
- The EUV light source is considered the most complex element of EUV lithography, generating light at 13.5 nanometres wavelength
- Germany's Carl Zeiss AG supplies the precision optics that direct the EUV light onto silicon wafers coated with photoresist
