## Key Points

- DeepSeek V4 is highly anticipated as the next major coding model release, but rumors need to be separated from reality
- Three confirmed technical advancements: Engram Architecture (conditional memory separating static knowledge from dynamic reasoning), 1M+ token context window built on DeepSeek Sparse Attention, and radical cost disruption with potential pricing of $0.27 per 1M tokens
- DeepSeek is launching into a competitive field with recent releases from MiniMax, Z AI, Moonshot AI, and Google all pushing the boundaries
- Unverified rumors include claims of 83.7% SWE-Bench Verified performance beating Claude and GPT models, but these lack independent verification
- The Engram + DSA combination could revolutionize agentic workflows by enabling multi-file reasoning, deterministic debugging, and local privacy
- DeepSeek V3 has been popular for its predictability and efficiency despite not having the best reasoning capabilities
- The article questions whether DeepSeek V4 will succeed in the competitive landscape where other models are already setting high benchmarks
