## Key Points

Google Gemini is developing a new "projects" feature, similar to ChatGPT's.
This feature will enable users to organize files and chats related to specific topics within compartmentalized workspaces.
Recent beta builds of the Google app (version 16.48.54.sa.arm64) reveal a more detailed UI for Gemini projects.
The project interface includes options for naming projects, adding descriptions, and corralling file sources.
Users will be able to pin frequently used projects for easier access.
A 10-file limit per project has been observed, with a question remaining if this limit will vary for premium Gemini users.
The development of Gemini projects appears to be nearing completion, suggesting a formal launch might be imminent.

## Key Topics Discussed

Hey everyone! We've got some exciting news from the Google camp regarding Gemini. It looks like Google is gearing up to launch a brand new 'projects' feature for Gemini, and if you're familiar with ChatGPT, this concept might sound a bit familiar. Essentially, this new functionality is all about organization, creating dedicated workspaces where you can neatly group all your files and chats around specific topics. This means no more scattered information when you're tackling different subjects! We've managed to get an early peek at how this is shaping up, thanks to a recent beta build of the Google app, version 16.48.54.sa.arm64. While it's not live for everyone just yet, the detailed UI gives us a pretty clear picture. You'll be able to name your projects, add descriptions to keep your goals clear, and bring together all your relevant files in one spot. Plus, for those projects you're always working on, there's a handy pinning feature to keep them right at the top of your list. One interesting detail we noted is a 10-file limit per project, which makes us wonder if premium Gemini users might get a little more wiggle room there. But all in all, it seems like Google is really close to rolling this out, with the major pieces already falling into place. Get ready for a more organized Gemini experience!
