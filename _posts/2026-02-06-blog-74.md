## Key Points

- This project investigates whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, already successful in language models for tasks like math, can be adapted to improve *autoregressive image generation*.
- Three CoT techniques are explored: **test-time computation scaling** (ORM, PARM, PARM++), **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**, and **combining these techniques** for better results.
- **PARM** (Potential Assessment Reward Model) dynamically evaluates each step of image generation, blending strengths from existing reward models.
- **PARM++** adds a *self-correction mechanism* to help generative models fix earlier mistakes in image generation.
- The research was accepted for presentation at **CVPR 2025**, a top-tier computer vision conference, and the paper is available on arXiv.
- The team has open-sourced training code, datasets, and checkpoints for models like **ORM, PARM, and DPO**, making it accessible for further experimentation.
- A baseline model (**Show-o**) is provided, along with fine-tuned and zero-shot versions of ORM, PARM, and DPO-based approaches.
- The repository includes detailed instructions for setting up the environment, downloading models, and running fine-tuning or training scripts.
- If you use this work, the team kindly asks you to cite their paper using the provided BibTeX entry.
- The project also links to additional research in **3D vision, mathematical visual reasoning, and multi-modal search engines** by the same team.

## Key Topics Discussed

Alright, folks! If you're into AI and image generation, you're going to love what we're diving into today. The team behind this GitHub repository has been exploring a fascinating question: *Can Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which has already revolutionized language models in areas like math and problem-solving, be applied to image generation?* Spoiler alert: they’ve made some seriously cool progress, and it’s all open-source for us to check out and even build on ourselves—how awesome is that? 🎉

Chain-of-Thought reasoning is all about breaking down complex tasks into smaller, logical steps. For language models, this has been a game-changer, especially in tasks like solving math problems or understanding intricate instructions. But when it comes to generating images step by step, it’s been a bit of an open question. This project is the *first comprehensive investigation* into whether CoT strategies can really enhance autoregressive image generation—the process where images are created pixel by pixel or patch by patch based on a sequence of decisions.

The team focused on three main techniques to make this work:

1. **Scaling Test-Time Computation**: They looked at methods like ORM (Online Reward Model) and PRM (Potential Reward Model), and even proposed some upgrades—**PARM** and **PARM++**. PARM dynamically assesses each generation step, almost like it’s giving the model real-time feedback. PARM++ takes this a step further by introducing a *reflection mechanism*, which allows the generative model to self-correct earlier unsatisfactory parts of the image. Imagine a model that can go back and say, *'Oops, that hand looks a bit off—let me try again!'*—that’s the kind of magic we’re talking about here.

2. **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: This is a technique used to align the model’s output with human preferences. The team explored how DPO can be integrated into image generation to fine-tune the model’s behavior based on what we actually like or find useful in generated images.

3. **Combining Techniques**: They didn’t stop at just one approach. Instead, they combined these methods to see if they could create a *complementary effect*, resulting in even better image generation performance. And guess what? It worked! Their experiments show that these techniques can indeed be adapted and merged to significantly improve how images are generated.

Now, why is this such a big deal? Well, the team’s work was accepted for presentation at **CVPR 2025**, one of the most prestigious conferences in computer vision. They’ve even released their paper on arXiv, so you can dive into the technical details if you’re curious. The paper is titled *'Can We Generate Images with CoT? Let’s Verify and Reinforce Image Generation Step by Step'*, and it’s packed with insights and methodologies.

But here’s the best part: **they’ve open-sourced everything!** That means you can clone their repository, set up your own environment, and start experimenting with their models and techniques. They’ve provided step-by-step instructions, including how to create a conda environment, install dependencies like PyTorch and TorchVision, and even download pre-trained models and datasets. If you’re into fine-tuning or training these models, they’ve got scripts ready for you to run—whether it’s for ORM, PARM, or DPO-based approaches.

For those of you who want to jump right in, they’ve included commands to run the baseline model (**Show-o**), zero-shot ORM, fine-tuned ORM, PARM, and various DPO iterations. There’s even a command to combine iterative DPO with PARM guidance for maximum performance. It’s like having a cheat sheet to build and test some of the most advanced image generation models out there!

And if you’re working on a project or research that uses this work, they’ve made it super easy to give them credit with a provided BibTeX citation. That’s just good academic practice, folks.

Oh, and this isn’t just about 2D images! The team has also linked to other exciting projects in their repository, like **3D vision, mathematical visual reasoning with LLMs, and even multi-modal search engines**. If you’re into pushing the boundaries of AI across different dimensions, there’s plenty here to explore.

So, whether you’re a researcher, a developer, or just someone who loves seeing how AI can get smarter and more creative, this project is a goldmine. It’s not just about generating images—it’s about *how* we generate them, and making that process more intelligent, adaptive, and aligned with what we actually want. And the fact that it’s all open-source? That’s just icing on the cake.

Let’s get into the details of how you can set this up and start playing around with these models. Trust me, you won’t want to miss this!
